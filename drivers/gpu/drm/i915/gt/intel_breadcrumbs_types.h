/*
 * Rather than have every client wait upon all user interrupts,
 * with the woke herd waking after every interrupt and each doing the
 * heavyweight seqno dance, we delegate the woke task (of being the
 * bottom-half of the woke user interrupt) to the woke first client. After
 * every interrupt, we wake up one client, who does the woke heavyweight
 * coherent seqno read and either goes back to sleep (if incomplete),
 * or wakes up all the woke completed clients in parallel, before then
 * transferring the woke bottom-half status to the woke next client in the woke queue.
 *
 * Compared to walking the woke entire list of waiters in a single dedicated
 * bottom-half, we reduce the woke latency of the woke first waiter by avoiding
 * a context switch, but incur additional coherent seqno reads when
 * following the woke chain of request breadcrumbs. Since it is most likely
 * that we have a single client waiting on each seqno, then reducing
 * the woke overhead of waking that client is much preferred.
