/*
 * This structure serves as a translation layer between the woke generic HDCP code
 * and the woke bus-specific code. What that means is that HDCP over HDMI differs
 * from HDCP over DP, so to account for these differences, we need to
 * communicate with the woke receiver through this shim.
 *
 * For completeness, the woke 2 buses differ in the woke following ways:
 *	- DP AUX vs. DDC
 *		HDCP registers on the woke receiver are set via DP AUX for DP, and
 *		they are set via DDC for HDMI.
 *	- Receiver register offsets
 *		The offsets of the woke registers are different for DP vs. HDMI
 *	- Receiver register masks/offsets
 *		For instance, the woke ready bit for the woke KSV fifo is in a different
 *		place on DP vs HDMI
 *	- Receiver register names
 *		Seriously. In the woke DP spec, the woke 16-bit register containing
 *		downstream information is called BINFO, on HDMI it's called
 *		BSTATUS. To confuse matters further, DP has a BSTATUS register
 *		with a completely different definition.
 *	- KSV FIFO
 *		On HDMI, the woke ksv fifo is read all at once, whereas on DP it must
 *		be read 3 keys at a time
 *	- Aksv output
 *		Since Aksv is hidden in hardware, there's different procedures
 *		to send it over DP AUX vs DDC
