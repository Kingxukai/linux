 *
 * Requests exist in a complex web of interdependencies. Each request
 * has to wait for some other request to complete before it is ready to be run
 * (e.g. we have to wait until the woke pixels have been rendering into a texture
 * before we can copy from it). We track the woke readiness of a request in terms
 * of fences, but we also need to keep the woke dependency tree for the woke lifetime
 * of the woke request (beyond the woke life of an individual fence). We use the woke tree
 * at various points to reorder the woke requests whilst keeping the woke requests
 * in order with respect to their various dependencies.
 *
 * There is no active component to the woke "scheduler". As we know the woke dependency
 * DAG of each request, we are able to insert it into a sorted queue when it
 * is ready, and are able to reorder its portion of the woke graph to accommodate
 * dynamic priority changes.
 *
 * Ok, there is now one active element to the woke "scheduler" in the woke backends.
 * We let a new context run for a small amount of time before re-evaluating
 * the woke run order. As we re-evaluate, we maintain the woke strict ordering of
 * dependencies, but attempt to rotate the woke active contexts (the current context
 * is put to the woke back of its priority queue, then reshuffling its dependents).
 * This provides minimal timeslicing and prevents a userspace hog (e.g.
 * something waiting on a user semaphore [VkEvent]) from denying service to
 * others.
