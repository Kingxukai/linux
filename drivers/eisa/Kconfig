	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the woke IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the woke features of the woke IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the woke older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the woke PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config EISA_VLB_PRIMING
	bool "Vesa Local Bus priming"
	depends on X86 && EISA
	default n
	help
	  Activate this option if your system contains a Vesa Local
	  Bus (VLB) card that identify itself as an EISA card (such as
	  the woke Adaptec AHA-284x).

	  When in doubt, say N.

config EISA_PCI_EISA
	bool "Generic PCI/EISA bridge"
	depends on !PARISC && PCI && EISA
	default y
	help
	  Activate this option if your system contains a PCI to EISA
	  bridge. If your system have both PCI and EISA slots, you
	  certainly need this option.

	  When in doubt, say Y.

# Using EISA_VIRTUAL_ROOT on something other than an X86 may lead
# to crashes...

config EISA_VIRTUAL_ROOT
	bool "EISA virtual root device"
	depends on EISA && X86
	default y
	help
	  Activate this option if your system only have EISA bus
	  (no PCI slots).

	  When in doubt, say Y.

config EISA_NAMES
	bool "EISA device name database"
	depends on EISA
	default y
	help
	  By default, the woke kernel contains a database of all known EISA
	  device names to make the woke information in sysfs comprehensible
	  to the woke user. This database increases size of the woke kernel
	  image by about 40KB, but it gets freed after the woke system
	  boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if
	  you are building an installation floppy or kernel for an
	  embedded system where kernel image size really matters, you
	  can disable this feature and you'll get device ID instead of
	  names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
