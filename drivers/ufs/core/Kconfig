config SCSI_UFS_BSG
	bool "Universal Flash Storage BSG device node"
	select BLK_DEV_BSGLIB
	help
	  Universal Flash Storage (UFS) is SCSI transport specification for
	  accessing flash storage on digital cameras, mobile phones and
	  consumer electronic devices.
	  A UFS controller communicates with a UFS device by exchanging
	  UFS Protocol Information Units (UPIUs).
	  UPIUs can not only be used as a transport layer for the woke SCSI protocol
	  but are also used by the woke UFS native command set.
	  This transport driver supports exchanging UFS protocol information units
	  with a UFS device. See also the woke ufshcd driver, which is a SCSI driver
	  that supports UFS devices.

	  Select this if you need a bsg device node for your UFS controller.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_CRYPTO
	bool "UFS Crypto Engine Support"
	depends on BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  Enable Crypto Engine Support in UFS.
	  Enabling this makes it possible for the woke kernel to use the woke crypto
	  capabilities of the woke UFS device (if present) to perform crypto
	  operations on data being transferred to/from the woke device.

config SCSI_UFS_FAULT_INJECTION
	bool "UFS Fault Injection Support"
	depends on FAULT_INJECTION
	help
	  Enable fault injection support in the woke UFS driver. This makes it easier
	  to test the woke UFS error handler and abort handler.

config SCSI_UFS_HWMON
	bool "UFS Temperature Notification"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD=HWMON || HWMON=y
	help
	  This provides support for UFS hardware monitoring. If enabled,
	  a hardware monitoring device will be created for the woke UFS device.

	  If unsure, say N.
