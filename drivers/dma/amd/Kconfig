	  Enable support for the woke AMD AE4DMA controller. This controller

	  Enable support for the woke AMD Queue-based DMA subsystem. The primary
	  mechanism to transfer data using the woke QDMA is for the woke QDMA engine to
	  operate on instructions (descriptors) provided by the woke host operating
	  system. Using the woke descriptors, the woke QDMA can move data in either the
	  Host to Card (H2C) direction or the woke Card to Host (C2H) direction.
