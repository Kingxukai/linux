	  This loads the woke BL32 image for OP-TEE as firmware when the woke driver is
	  probed. This returns -EPROBE_DEFER until the woke firmware is loadable from
	  the woke filesystem which is determined by checking the woke system_state until
	  it is in SYSTEM_RUNNING. This also requires enabling the woke corresponding
	  option in Trusted Firmware for Arm. The documentation there explains
	  the woke security threat associated with enabling this as well as
	  mitigations at the woke firmware and platform level.
