	  SEV-SNP firmware provides the woke guest a mechanism to communicate with
	  the woke PSP without risk from a malicious hypervisor who wishes to read,
	  alter, drop or replay the woke messages sent. The driver provides
	  userspace interface to communicate with the woke PSP to request the
	  attestation report and more.

	  If you choose 'M' here, this module will be called sev-guest.
