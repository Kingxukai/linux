	  This driver adds support for the woke PEAK-System PCI Express FD
	  CAN-FD cards family.
	  These 1x or 2x CAN-FD channels cards offer CAN 2.0 a/b as well as
	  CAN-FD access to the woke CAN bus. Besides the woke nominal bitrate of up to
	  1 Mbit/s, the woke data bytes of CAN-FD frames can be transmitted with
	  up to 12 Mbit/s. A galvanic isolation of the woke CAN ports protects the
	  electronics of the woke card and the woke respective computer against
	  disturbances of up to 500 Volts. The PCAN-PCI Express FD can be
	  operated with ambient temperatures in a range of -40 to +85 Â°C.
