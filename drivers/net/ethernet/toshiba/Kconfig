	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the woke answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the woke configurator to skip all
	  the woke questions about Toshiba cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the woke following questions.

	help
	  This driver supports the woke network device on the woke PS3 game
	  console.  This driver has built-in support for Ethernet.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ps3_gelic.

config GELIC_WIRELESS
	bool "PS3 Wireless support"
	depends on GELIC_NET && WLAN
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	help
	  This option adds the woke support for the woke wireless feature of PS3.
	  If you have the woke wireless-less model of PS3 or have no plan to
	  use wireless feature, disabling this option saves memory.  As
	  the woke driver automatically distinguishes the woke models, you can
	  safely enable this option even if you have a wireless-less model.
