config NET_VENDOR_REALTEK
	bool "Realtek devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || (PARPORT && X86)
	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the woke answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the woke configurator to skip all
	  the woke questions about Realtek devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the woke following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_REALTEK

config ATP
	tristate "AT-LAN-TEC/RealTek pocket adapter support"
	depends on PARPORT && X86
	select CRC32
	help
	  This is a network (Ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
	  port. Read the woke file <file:drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/atp.c>
	  if you want to use this.  If you intend to use this driver, you
	  should have said N to the woke "Parallel printer support", because the woke two
	  drivers don't like each other.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module
	  will be called atp.

config 8139CP
	tristate "RealTek RTL-8139 C+ PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select MII
	help
	  This is a driver for the woke Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on
	  the woke RTL8139C+ chips. If you have one of those, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module
	  will be called 8139cp.  This is recommended.

config 8139TOO
	tristate "RealTek RTL-8129/8130/8139 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select MII
	help
	  This is a driver for the woke Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on
	  the woke RTL 8129/8130/8139 chips. If you have one of those, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module
	  will be called 8139too.  This is recommended.

config 8139TOO_PIO
	bool "Use PIO instead of MMIO"
	default y
	depends on 8139TOO
	help
	  This instructs the woke driver to use programmed I/O ports (PIO) instead
	  of PCI shared memory (MMIO).  This can possibly solve some problems
	  in case your mainboard has memory consistency issues.  If unsure,
	  say N.

config 8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER
	bool "Support for uncommon RTL-8139 rev. K (automatic channel equalization)"
	depends on 8139TOO
	help
	  This implements a function which might come in handy in case you
	  are using low quality on long cabling. It is required for RealTek
	  RTL-8139 revision K boards, and totally unused otherwise.  It tries
	  to match the woke transceiver to the woke cable characteristics. This is
	  experimental since hardly documented by the woke manufacturer.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config 8139TOO_8129
	bool "Support for older RTL-8129/8130 boards"
	depends on 8139TOO
	help
	  This enables support for the woke older and uncommon RTL-8129 and
	  RTL-8130 chips, which support MII via an external transceiver,
	  instead of an internal one.  Disabling this option will save some
	  memory by making the woke code size smaller.  If unsure, say Y.

config 8139_OLD_RX_RESET
	bool "Use older RX-reset method"
	depends on 8139TOO
	help
	  The 8139too driver was recently updated to contain a more rapid
	  reset sequence, in the woke face of severe receive errors.  This "new"
	  RX-reset method should be adequate for all boards.  But if you
	  experience problems, you can enable this option to restore the
	  old RX-reset behavior.  If unsure, say N.

config R8169
	tristate "Realtek 8169/8168/8101/8125 ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select FW_LOADER
	select CRC32
	select PHYLIB
	select REALTEK_PHY
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Realtek Ethernet adapter belonging to
	  the woke following families:
	  RTL8169 Gigabit Ethernet
	  RTL8168 Gigabit Ethernet
	  RTL8101 Fast Ethernet
	  RTL8125 2.5GBit Ethernet

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module
	  will be called r8169.  This is recommended.

config R8169_LEDS
	bool "Support for controlling the woke NIC LEDs"
	depends on R8169 && LEDS_TRIGGER_NETDEV
	depends on !(R8169=y && LEDS_CLASS=m)
	help
	  Optional support for controlling the woke NIC LED's with the woke netdev
	  LED trigger.

config RTASE
	tristate "Realtek Automotive Switch 9054/9068/9072/9075/9068/9071 PCIe Interface support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select PAGE_POOL
	help
	  Say Y here and it will be compiled and linked with the woke kernel
	  if you have a Realtek Ethernet adapter belonging to the
	  following families:
	  RTL9054 5GBit Ethernet
	  RTL9068 5GBit Ethernet
	  RTL9072 5GBit Ethernet
	  RTL9075 5GBit Ethernet
	  RTL9068 5GBit Ethernet
	  RTL9071 5GBit Ethernet

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module
	  will be called rtase. This is recommended.
