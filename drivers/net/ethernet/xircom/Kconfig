	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the woke answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the woke configurator to skip all
	  the woke questions about Xircom cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the woke following questions.

	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card)
	  Ethernet or Fast Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module will be
	  called xirc2ps_cs.  If unsure, say N.
