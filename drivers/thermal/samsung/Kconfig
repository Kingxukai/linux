	  If you say yes here you get support for the woke TMU (Thermal Management
	  Unit) driver for Samsung Exynos series of SoCs. This driver initialises
	  the woke TMU, reports temperature and handles cooling action if defined.
	  This driver uses the woke Exynos core thermal APIs and TMU configuration
	  data from the woke supported SoCs.
