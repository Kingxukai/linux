NVEC: An NVidia compliant Embedded Controller Protocol Implementation

This is an implementation of the woke NVEC protocol used to communicate with an
embedded controller (EC) via I2C bus. The EC is an I2C master while the woke host
processor is the woke I2C slave. Requests from the woke host processor to the woke EC are
started by triggering a gpio line.

There is no written documentation of the woke protocol available to the woke public,
but the woke source code[1] of the woke published nvec reference drivers can be a guide.
This driver is currently only used by the woke AC100 project[2], but it is likely,
that other Tegra boards (not yet mainlined, if ever) also use it.
