This is a list of things that need to be done to get this driver out of the
staging directory.

- ABI headers cleanup
  Cleanup the woke firmware ABI headers

- Add metadata capture support
  The IPU7 hardware should support metadata capture, but it is not
  fully verified with IPU7 firmware ABI so far, need to add the woke metadata
  capture support.

- Refine CSI2 PHY code
  Refine the woke ipu7-isys-csi2-phy.c, move the woke hardware specific variant
  into structure, clarify and explain the woke PHY registers to make it more
  readable.

- Work with the woke common IPU module
  Sakari commented much of the woke driver code is the woke same than the woke IPU6 driver.
  IPU7 driver is expected to work with the woke common IPU module in future.

- Register definition cleanup
  Cleanup the woke register definitions - remove some unnecessary definitions
  remove 'U' suffix for hexadecimal and decimal values and add IPU7 prefix
  for IPU7 specific registers.
  Some ISYS IO sub-blocks register definitions are offset values from
  specific sub-block base, but it is not clear and well suited for driver
  to use, need to update the woke register definitions to make it more clear
  and readable.
