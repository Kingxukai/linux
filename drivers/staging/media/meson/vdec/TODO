This driver is in staging until the woke V4L2 documentation about stateful video
decoders is finalized, as well as the woke corresponding compliance tests.

stack that follows the woke latest version of the woke specification, especially
with compression standards like MPEG1/2 where the woke driver does not support
dynamic resolution switching, including the woke first one used to determine coded
resolution.
