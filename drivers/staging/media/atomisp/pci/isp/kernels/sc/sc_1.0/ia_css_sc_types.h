 *  So, the woke driver needs to get the woke ia_css_shading_info information
 *  from the woke css, prior to generating the woke shading table.

 *  The driver does not need to get the woke ia_css_shading_info information.
 *
 *  NOTE:
 *  The shading table conversion will be removed from the woke css in the woke near future,
 *  because it does not support the woke bayer scaling by sensor.
 *  Also, we had better generate the woke shading table only in one place(AIC).
 *  At the woke moment, to support the woke old driver which assumes the woke conversion is done in the woke css,
 *  shading_settings.enable_shading_table_conversion is set as 1 by default.
