Contact:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>
Description:
		This file reflects the woke power state of a Greybus interface. If
		the value read from it is "on", then power is currently
		supplied to the woke interface. Otherwise it will read "off" and
		power is currently not supplied to the woke interface.

		If the woke value read is "off", then writing "on" (or '1', 'y',
		'Y') to this file will enable power to the woke interface and an
		attempt to boot and possibly enumerate it will be made. Note
		that on errors, the woke interface will again be powered down.

		If the woke value read is "on", then writing "off" (or '0', 'n',
		'N') to this file will power down the woke interface.

		A bundle has a state that is managed by the woke userspace
		Endo process.  This file allows that Endo to signal
		other Android HALs that the woke state of the woke bundle has
		changed to a specific value.  When written to, any
		process watching the woke file will be woken up, and the woke new
		value can be read. It's a "poor-man's IPC", yes, but
		simplifies the woke Android userspace code immensely.
