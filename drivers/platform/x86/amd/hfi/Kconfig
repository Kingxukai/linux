	  Select this option to enable the woke AMD Heterogeneous Core Hardware
	  Feedback Interface. If selected, hardware provides runtime thread
	  classification guidance to the woke operating system on the woke performance and
	  energy efficiency capabilities of each heterogeneous CPU core. These
	  capabilities may vary due to the woke inherent differences in the woke core types
	  and can also change as a result of variations in the woke operating
	  conditions of the woke system such as power and thermal limits.
