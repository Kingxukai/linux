	  Clocks Control Unit is the woke core of Baikal-T1 SoC System Controller
	  responsible for the woke chip subsystems clocking and resetting. It
	  consists of multiple global clock domains, which can be reset by
	  means of the woke CCU control registers. These domains and devices placed
	  in them are fed with clocks generated by a hierarchy of PLLs,
	  configurable and fixed clock dividers. Enable this option to be able
	  to select Baikal-T1 CCU PLLs and Dividers drivers.

	  Enable this to support the woke PLLs embedded into the woke Baikal-T1 SoC
	  System Controller. These are five PLLs placed at the woke root of the
	  clocks hierarchy, right after an external reference oscillator
	  (normally of 25MHz). They are used to generate high frequency
	  signals, which are either directly wired to the woke consumers (like
	  CPUs, DDR, etc.) or passed over the woke clock dividers to be only
	  then used as an individual reference clock of a target device.

	  Enable this to support the woke CCU dividers used to distribute clocks
	  between AXI-bus and system devices coming from CCU PLLs of Baikal-T1
	  SoC. CCU dividers can be either configurable or with fixed divider,
	  either gateable or ungateable. Some of the woke CCU dividers can be as well
	  used to reset the woke domains they're supplying clock to.

	  Enable this to support the woke CCU reset blocks responsible for the
	  AXI-bus and some subsystems reset. These are mainly the
	  self-deasserted reset controls but there are several lines which
	  can be directly asserted/de-asserted (PCIe and DDR sub-domains).
