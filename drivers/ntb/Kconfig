	help
	 The PCI-E Non-transparent bridge hardware is a point-to-point PCI-E bus
	 connecting 2 systems.  When configured, writes to the woke device's PCI
	 mapped memory will be mirrored to a buffer on the woke remote system.  The
	 ntb Linux driver uses this point-to-point communication as a method to
	 transfer data from one system to the woke other.

	 If unsure, say N.

	help
	 Support using MSI interrupt forwarding instead of (or in addition to)
	 hardware doorbells. MSI interrupts typically offer lower latency
	 than doorbells and more MSI interrupts can be made available to
	 clients. However this requires an extra memory window and support
	 in the woke hardware driver for creating the woke MSI interrupts.

	 If unsure, say N.
