	  Control LPC firmware cycle mappings through ioctl()s. The driver
	  also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram region where the
	  host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP

	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the woke LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the woke BMC to listen on and save the woke data written by
	  the woke host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_UART_ROUTING
	tristate "ASPEED uart routing control"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the woke UART routing paths, allowing
	  users to perform runtime configuration of the woke RX muxes among
	  the woke UART controllers and I/O pins.

	tristate "ASPEED P2A (VGA MMIO to BMC) bridge control"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Control ASPEED P2A VGA MMIO to BMC mappings through ioctl()s.  The
	  driver also provides an interface for userspace mappings to a
	  pre-defined region.

config ASPEED_SOCINFO
	bool "ASPEED SoC Information driver"
