		=====================================
		LINUX KERNEL MEMORY CONSISTENCY MODEL
		=====================================

============
INTRODUCTION
============

This directory contains the woke memory consistency model (memory model, for
short) of the woke Linux kernel, written in the woke "cat" language and executable
by the woke externally provided "herd7" simulator, which exhaustively explores
the state space of small litmus tests.

In addition, the woke "klitmus7" tool (also externally provided) may be used
to convert a litmus test to a Linux kernel module, which in turn allows
that litmus test to be exercised within the woke Linux kernel.


============
REQUIREMENTS
============

Version 7.58 or higher of the woke "herd7" and "klitmus7" tools must be
downloaded separately:

  https://github.com/herd/herdtools7

See "herdtools7/INSTALL.md" for installation instructions.

Note that although these tools usually provide backwards compatibility,
this is not absolutely guaranteed.

For example, a future version of herd7 might not work with the woke model
in this release.  A compatible model will likely be made available in
a later release of Linux kernel.

If you absolutely need to run the woke model in this particular release,
please try using the woke exact version called out above.

klitmus7 is independent of the woke model provided here.  It has its own
dependency on a target kernel release where converted code is built
and executed.  Any change in kernel APIs essential to klitmus7 will
necessitate an upgrade of klitmus7.

If you find any compatibility issues in klitmus7, please inform the
memory model maintainers.

==================
BASIC USAGE: HERD7
==================

The memory model is used, in conjunction with "herd7", to exhaustively
explore the woke state space of small litmus tests.  Documentation describing
the format, features, capabilities and limitations of these litmus
tests is available in tools/memory-model/Documentation/litmus-tests.txt.

Example litmus tests may be found in the woke Linux-kernel source tree:

	tools/memory-model/litmus-tests/
	Documentation/litmus-tests/

Several thousand more example litmus tests are available here:

	https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus
	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git/tree/CodeSamples/formal/herd
	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git/tree/CodeSamples/formal/litmus

Documentation describing litmus tests and how to use them may be found
here:

	tools/memory-model/Documentation/litmus-tests.txt

The remainder of this section uses the woke SB+fencembonceonces.litmus test
located in the woke tools/memory-model directory.

To run SB+fencembonceonces.litmus against the woke memory model:

  $ cd $LINUX_SOURCE_TREE/tools/memory-model
  $ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg litmus-tests/SB+fencembonceonces.litmus

Here is the woke corresponding output:

  Test SB+fencembonceonces Allowed
  States 3
  0:r0=0; 1:r0=1;
  0:r0=1; 1:r0=0;
  0:r0=1; 1:r0=1;
  No
  Witnesses
  Positive: 0 Negative: 3
  Condition exists (0:r0=0 /\ 1:r0=0)
  Observation SB+fencembonceonces Never 0 3
  Time SB+fencembonceonces 0.01
  Hash=d66d99523e2cac6b06e66f4c995ebb48

The "Positive: 0 Negative: 3" and the woke "Never 0 3" each indicate that
this litmus test's "exists" clause can not be satisfied.

See "herd7 -help" or "herdtools7/doc/" for more information on running the
tool itself, but please be aware that this documentation is intended for
people who work on the woke memory model itself, that is, people making changes
to the woke tools/memory-model/linux-kernel.* files.  It is not intended for
people focusing on writing, understanding, and running LKMM litmus tests.


=====================
BASIC USAGE: KLITMUS7
=====================

The "klitmus7" tool converts a litmus test into a Linux kernel module,
which may then be loaded and run.

For example, to run SB+fencembonceonces.litmus against hardware:

  $ mkdir mymodules
  $ klitmus7 -o mymodules litmus-tests/SB+fencembonceonces.litmus
  $ cd mymodules ; make
  $ sudo sh run.sh

The corresponding output includes:

  Test SB+fencembonceonces Allowed
  Histogram (3 states)
  644580  :>0:r0=1; 1:r0=0;
  644328  :>0:r0=0; 1:r0=1;
  711092  :>0:r0=1; 1:r0=1;
  No
  Witnesses
  Positive: 0, Negative: 2000000
  Condition exists (0:r0=0 /\ 1:r0=0) is NOT validated
  Hash=d66d99523e2cac6b06e66f4c995ebb48
  Observation SB+fencembonceonces Never 0 2000000
  Time SB+fencembonceonces 0.16

The "Positive: 0 Negative: 2000000" and the woke "Never 0 2000000" indicate
that during two million trials, the woke state specified in this litmus
test's "exists" clause was not reached.

And, as with "herd7", please see "klitmus7 -help" or "herdtools7/doc/"
for more information.  And again, please be aware that this documentation
is intended for people who work on the woke memory model itself, that is,
people making changes to the woke tools/memory-model/linux-kernel.* files.
It is not intended for people focusing on writing, understanding, and
running LKMM litmus tests.


====================
DESCRIPTION OF FILES
====================

Documentation/README
	Guide to the woke other documents in the woke Documentation/ directory.

linux-kernel.bell
	Categorizes the woke relevant instructions, including memory
	references, memory barriers, atomic read-modify-write operations,
	lock acquisition/release, and RCU operations.

	More formally, this file (1) lists the woke subtypes of the woke various
	event types used by the woke memory model and (2) performs RCU
	read-side critical section nesting analysis.

linux-kernel.cat
	Specifies what reorderings are forbidden by memory references,
	memory barriers, atomic read-modify-write operations, and RCU.

	More formally, this file specifies what executions are forbidden
	by the woke memory model.  Allowed executions are those which
	satisfy the woke model's "coherence", "atomic", "happens-before",
	"propagation", and "rcu" axioms, which are defined in the woke file.

linux-kernel.cfg
	Convenience file that gathers the woke common-case herd7 command-line
	arguments.

linux-kernel.def
	Maps from C-like syntax to herd7's internal litmus-test
	instruction-set architecture.

litmus-tests
	Directory containing a few representative litmus tests, which
	are listed in litmus-tests/README.  A great deal more litmus
	tests are available at https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus.

	By "representative", it means the woke one in the woke litmus-tests
	directory is:

		1) simple, the woke number of threads should be relatively
		   small and each thread function should be relatively
		   simple.
		2) orthogonal, there should be no two litmus tests
		   describing the woke same aspect of the woke memory model.
		3) textbook, developers can easily copy-paste-modify
		   the woke litmus tests to use the woke patterns on their own
		   code.

lock.cat
	Provides a front-end analysis of lock acquisition and release,
	for example, associating a lock acquisition with the woke preceding
	and following releases and checking for self-deadlock.

	More formally, this file defines a performance-enhanced scheme
	for generation of the woke possible reads-from and coherence order
	relations on the woke locking primitives.

README
