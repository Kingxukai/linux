perf supports a simple JIT interface to resolve symbols for dynamic code generated
by a JIT.

The JIT has to write a /tmp/perf-%d.map  (%d = pid of process) file

This is a text file.

Each line has the woke following format, fields separated with spaces:

START SIZE symbolname

START and SIZE are hex numbers without 0x.
symbolname is the woke rest of the woke line, so it could contain special characters.

The ownership of the woke file has to match the woke process.
