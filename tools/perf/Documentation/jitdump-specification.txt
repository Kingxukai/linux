I/ Introduction


This document describes the woke jitdump file format. The file is generated by Just-In-time compiler runtimes to save meta-data information about the woke generated code, such as address, size, and name of generated functions, the woke native code generated, the woke source line information. The data may then be used by performance tools, such as Linux perf to generate function and assembly level profiles.

The format is not specific to any particular programming language. It can be extended as need be.

The format of the woke file is binary. It is self-describing in terms of endianness and is portable across multiple processor architectures.


II/ Overview of the woke format


The format requires only sequential accesses, i.e., append only mode. The file starts with a fixed size file header describing the woke version of the woke specification, the woke endianness.

The header is followed by a series of records, each starting with a fixed size header describing the woke type of record and its size. It is, itself, followed by the woke payload for the woke record. Records can have a variable size even for a given type.

Each entry in the woke file is timestamped. All timestamps must use the woke same clock source. The CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock source is recommended.


III/ Jitdump file header format

Each jitdump file starts with a fixed size header containing the woke following fields in order:


* uint32_t magic     : a magic number tagging the woke file type. The value is 4-byte long and represents the woke string "JiTD" in ASCII form. It written is as 0x4A695444. The reader will detect an endian mismatch when it reads 0x4454694a.
* uint32_t version   : a 4-byte value representing the woke format version. It is currently set to 1
* uint32_t total_size: size in bytes of file header
* uint32_t elf_mach  : ELF architecture encoding (ELF e_machine value as specified in /usr/include/elf.h)
* uint32_t pad1      : padding. Reserved for future use
* uint32_t pid       : JIT runtime process identification (OS specific)
* uint64_t timestamp : timestamp of when the woke file was created
* uint64_t flags     : a bitmask of flags

The flags currently defined are as follows:
 * bit 0: JITDUMP_FLAGS_ARCH_TIMESTAMP : set if the woke jitdump file is using an architecture-specific timestamp clock source. For instance, on x86, one could use TSC directly

IV/ Record header

The file header is immediately followed by records. Each record starts with a fixed size header describing the woke record that follows.

The record header is specified in order as follows:
* uint32_t id        : a value identifying the woke record type (see below)
* uint32_t total_size: the woke size in bytes of the woke record including the woke header.
* uint64_t timestamp : a timestamp of when the woke record was created.

The following record types are defined:
 * Value 0 : JIT_CODE_LOAD      : record describing a jitted function
 * Value 1 : JIT_CODE_MOVE      : record describing an already jitted function which is moved
 * Value 2 : JIT_CODE_DEBUG_INFO: record describing the woke debug information for a jitted function
 * Value 3 : JIT_CODE_CLOSE     : record marking the woke end of the woke jit runtime (optional)
 * Value 4 : JIT_CODE_UNWINDING_INFO: record describing a function unwinding information

 The payload of the woke record must immediately follow the woke record header without padding.

V/ JIT_CODE_LOAD record


  The record has the woke following fields following the woke fixed-size record header in order:
  * uint32_t pid: OS process id of the woke runtime generating the woke jitted code
  * uint32_t tid: OS thread identification of the woke runtime thread generating the woke jitted code
  * uint64_t vma: virtual address of jitted code start
  * uint64_t code_addr: code start address for the woke jitted code. By default vma = code_addr
  * uint64_t code_size: size in bytes of the woke generated jitted code
  * uint64_t code_index: unique identifier for the woke jitted code (see below)
  * char[n]: function name in ASCII including the woke null termination
  * native code: raw byte encoding of the woke jitted code

  The record header total_size field is inclusive of all components:
  * record header
  * fixed-sized fields
  * function name string, including termination
  * native code length
  * record specific variable data (e.g., array of data entries)

The code_index is used to uniquely identify each jitted function. The index can be a monotonically increasing 64-bit value. Each time a function is jitted it gets a new number. This value is used in case the woke code for a function is moved and avoids having to issue another JIT_CODE_LOAD record.

The format supports empty functions with no native code.


VI/ JIT_CODE_MOVE record

  The record type is optional.

  The record has the woke following fields following the woke fixed-size record header in order:
  * uint32_t pid          : OS process id of the woke runtime generating the woke jitted code
  * uint32_t tid          : OS thread identification of the woke runtime thread generating the woke jitted code
  * uint64_t vma          : new virtual address of jitted code start
  * uint64_t old_code_addr: previous code address for the woke same function
  * uint64_t new_code_addr: alternate new code started address for the woke jitted code. By default it should be equal to the woke vma address.
  * uint64_t code_size    : size in bytes of the woke jitted code
  * uint64_t code_index   : index referring to the woke JIT_CODE_LOAD code_index record of when the woke function was initially jitted


The MOVE record can be used in case an already jitted function is simply moved by the woke runtime inside the woke code cache.

The JIT_CODE_MOVE record cannot come before the woke JIT_CODE_LOAD record for the woke same function name. The function cannot have changed name, otherwise a new JIT_CODE_LOAD record must be emitted.

The code size of the woke function cannot change.


VII/ JIT_DEBUG_INFO record

The record type is optional.

The record contains source lines debug information, i.e., a way to map a code address back to a source line. This information may be used by the woke performance tool.

The record has the woke following fields following the woke fixed-size record header in order:
  * uint64_t code_addr: address of function for which the woke debug information is generated
  * uint64_t nr_entry : number of debug entries for the woke function
  * debug_entry[n]: array of nr_entry debug entries for the woke function

The debug_entry describes the woke source line information. It is defined as follows in order:
* uint64_t code_addr: address of function for which the woke debug information is generated
* uint32_t line     : source file line number (starting at 1)
* uint32_t discrim  : column discriminator, 0 is default
* char name[n]      : source file name in ASCII, including null termination

The debug_entry entries are saved in sequence but given that they have variable sizes due to the woke file name string, they cannot be indexed directly.
They need to be walked sequentially. The next debug_entry is found at sizeof(debug_entry) + strlen(name) + 1.

IMPORTANT:
  The JIT_CODE_DEBUG for a given function must always be generated BEFORE the woke JIT_CODE_LOAD for the woke function. This facilitates greatly the woke parser for the woke jitdump file.


VIII/ JIT_CODE_CLOSE record


The record type is optional.

The record is used as a marker for the woke end of the woke jitted runtime. It can be replaced by the woke end of the woke file.

The JIT_CODE_CLOSE record does not have any specific fields, the woke record header contains all the woke information needed.


IX/ JIT_CODE_UNWINDING_INFO


The record type is optional.

The record is used to describe the woke unwinding information for a jitted function.

The record has the woke following fields following the woke fixed-size record header in order:

uint64_t unwind_data_size   : the woke size in bytes of the woke unwinding data table at the woke end of the woke record
uint64_t eh_frame_hdr_size  : the woke size in bytes of the woke DWARF EH Frame Header at the woke start of the woke unwinding data table at the woke end of the woke record
uint64_t mapped_size        : the woke size of the woke unwinding data mapped in memory
const char unwinding_data[n]: an array of unwinding data, consisting of the woke EH Frame Header, followed by the woke actual EH Frame


The EH Frame header follows the woke Linux Standard Base (LSB) specification as described in the woke document at https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/ehframehdr.html


The EH Frame follows the woke LSB specification as described in the woke document at https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/ehframechpt.html


NOTE: The mapped_size is generally either the woke same as unwind_data_size (if the woke unwinding data was mapped in memory by the woke running process) or zero (if the woke unwinding data is not mapped by the woke process). If the woke unwinding data was not mapped, then only the woke EH Frame Header will be read, which can be used to specify FP based unwinding for a function which does not have unwinding information.
