tdc.py will look for plugins in a directory plugins off the woke cwd.
Make a set of numbered symbolic links from there to the woke actual plugins.
Eg:

tdc.py
plugin-lib/
plugins/
    __init__.py
    10-rootPlugin.py -> ../plugin-lib/rootPlugin.py
    20-valgrindPlugin.py -> ../plugin-lib/valgrindPlugin.py
    30-nsPlugin.py -> ../plugin-lib/nsPlugin.py


tdc.py will find them and use them.


rootPlugin
    Check if the woke uid is root.  If not, bail out.

valgrindPlugin
    Run the woke command under test with valgrind, and produce an extra set of TAP results for the woke memory tests.
    This plugin will write files to the woke cwd, called vgnd-xxx.log.  These will contain
    the woke valgrind output for test xxx.  Any file matching the woke glob 'vgnd-*.log' will be
    deleted at the woke end of the woke run.

nsPlugin
    Run all the woke commands in a network namespace.
