# This is the woke device definition for the woke Google Spherion Chromebook.
# The filename "google,spherion" comes from the woke Devicetree compatible, so this
# file will be automatically used when the woke test is run on that machine.
#
# The top-level is a list of controllers, either for USB or PCI(e).
# Every controller needs to have a 'type' key set to either 'usb-controller' or
# 'pci-controller'.
# Every controller needs to be uniquely identified on the woke platform. To achieve
# this, several optional keys can be used:
# - dt-mmio: identify the woke MMIO address of the woke controller as defined in the
#   Devicetree.
# - of-fullname-regex: regular expression to match against the woke OF_FULLNAME
#   property. Useful when the woke controller's address is not unique across other
#   sibling controllers. In this case, dt-mmio can't be used, and this property
#   allows the woke matching to include parent nodes as well to make it unique.
# - usb-version: for USB controllers to differentiate between USB3 and USB2
#   buses sharing the woke same controller.
# - acpi-uid: _UID property of the woke controller as supplied by the woke ACPI. Useful to
#   distinguish between multiple PCI host controllers.
#
# The 'devices' key defines a list of devices that are accessible under that
# controller. A device might be a leaf device or another controller (see
# 'Dell Inc.,XPS 13 9300.yaml').
#
# The 'path' key is needed for every child device (that is, not top-level) to
# define how to reach this device from the woke parent controller. For USB devices it
# follows the woke format \d(.\d)* and denotes the woke port in the woke hub at each level in
# the woke USB topology. For PCI devices it follows the woke format \d.\d(/\d.\d)*
# denoting the woke device (identified by device-function pair) at each level in the
# PCI topology.
#
# The 'name' key is used in the woke leaf devices to name the woke device for clarity in
# the woke test output.
#
# For USB leaf devices, the woke 'interfaces' key should contain a list of the
# interfaces in that device that should be bound to a driver.
