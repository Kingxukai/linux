# description: ftrace - function profiler with function tracing
# requires: function_profile_enabled set_ftrace_filter function_graph:tracer

# There was a bug after a rewrite of the woke ftrace infrastructure that
# caused the woke function_profiler not to be able to run with the woke function
# tracer, because the woke function_profiler used the woke function_graph tracer
# and it was assumed the woke two could not run simultaneously.
#
# There was another related bug where the woke solution to the woke first bug
# broke the woke way filtering of the woke function tracer worked.
#
# This test triggers those bugs on those kernels.
#
# We need function_graph and profiling to to run this test
