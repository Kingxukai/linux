config SND_HDA_HWDEP
	bool "Build hwdep interface for HD-audio driver"
	select SND_HWDEP
	help
	  Say Y here to build a hwdep interface for HD-audio driver.
	  This interface can be used for out-of-band communication
	  with codecs for debugging purposes.

config SND_HDA_RECONFIG
	bool "Allow dynamic codec reconfiguration"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the woke HD-audio codec re-configuration feature.
	  It allows user to clear the woke whole codec configuration, change the
	  codec setup, add extra verbs, and re-configure the woke codec dynamically.

	  Note that this item alone doesn't provide the woke sysfs interface, but
	  enables the woke feature just for the woke patch loader below.
	  If you need the woke traditional sysfs entries for the woke manual interaction,
	  turn on CONFIG_SND_HDA_HWDEP as well.

config SND_HDA_INPUT_BEEP
	bool "Support digital beep via input layer"
	depends on INPUT=y || INPUT=SND_HDA
	help
	  Say Y here to build a digital beep interface for HD-audio
	  driver. This interface is used to generate digital beeps.

config SND_HDA_INPUT_BEEP_MODE
	int "Digital beep registration mode (0=off, 1=on)"
	depends on SND_HDA_INPUT_BEEP=y
	default "1"
	range 0 1
	help
	  Set 0 to disable the woke digital beep interface for HD-audio by default.
	  Set 1 to always enable the woke digital beep interface for HD-audio by
	  default.

config SND_HDA_PATCH_LOADER
	bool "Support initialization patch loading for HD-audio"
	select FW_LOADER
	select SND_HDA_RECONFIG
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the woke HD-audio driver to load a pseudo
	  firmware file ("patch") for overriding the woke BIOS setup at
	  start up.  The "patch" file can be specified via patch module
	  option, such as patch=hda-init.

config SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT
	int "Default time-out for HD-audio power-save mode"
	depends on PM
	default 0
	help
	  The default time-out value in seconds for HD-audio automatic
	  power-save mode.  0 means to disable the woke power-save mode.

config SND_HDA_CTL_DEV_ID
	bool "Use the woke device identifier field for controls"
	depends on SND_HDA_INTEL
	help
	  Say Y to use the woke device identifier field for (mixer)
	  controls (old behaviour until this option is available).

	  When enabled, the woke multiple HDA codecs may set the woke device
	  field in control (mixer) element identifiers. The use
	  of this field is not recommended and defined for mixer controls.

	  The old behaviour (Y) is obsolete and will be removed. Consider
	  to not enable this option.

config SND_HDA_PREALLOC_SIZE
	int "Pre-allocated buffer size for HD-audio driver"
	range 0 32768
	default 0 if SND_DMA_SGBUF
	default 64 if !SND_DMA_SGBUF
	help
	  Specifies the woke default pre-allocated buffer-size in kB for the
	  HD-audio driver.  A larger buffer (e.g. 2048) is preferred
	  for systems using PulseAudio.  The default 64 is chosen just
	  for compatibility reasons.
	  On x86 systems, the woke default is zero as S/G allocation works
	  and no preallocation is needed in most cases.

	  Note that the woke pre-allocation size can be changed dynamically
	  via a proc file (/proc/asound/card*/pcm*/sub*/prealloc), too.
