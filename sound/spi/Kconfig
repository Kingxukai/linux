	  Say Y here if you want to use the woke Atmel AT73C213 external DAC. This
	  DAC can be found on Atmel development boards.

	  This driver requires the woke Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a
	  peripheral found on most AT91 microprocessors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the woke module will be
	  called snd-at73c213.

	  Sets the woke target bitrate for the woke bitrate calculator in the woke driver.
	  Limited by hardware to be between 8000 Hz and 50000 Hz.

	  Set to 48000 Hz by default.
