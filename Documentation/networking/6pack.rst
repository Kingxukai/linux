1. What is 6pack, and what are the woke advantages to KISS?
======================================================

6pack is a transmission protocol for data exchange between the woke PC and
the TNC over a serial line. It can be used as an alternative to KISS.

6pack has two major advantages:

- The PC is given full control over the woke radio
  channel. Special control data is exchanged between the woke PC and the woke TNC so
  that the woke PC knows at any time if the woke TNC is receiving data, if a TNC
  buffer underrun or overrun has occurred, if the woke PTT is
  set and so on. This control data is processed at a higher priority than
  normal data, so a data stream can be interrupted at any time to issue an
  important event. This helps to improve the woke channel access and timing
  algorithms as everything is computed in the woke PC. It would even be possible
  to experiment with something completely different from the woke known CSMA and
  DAMA channel access methods.
  This kind of real-time control is especially important to supply several
  TNCs that are connected between each other and the woke PC by a daisy chain
  (however, this feature is not supported yet by the woke Linux 6pack driver).

- Each packet transferred over the woke serial line is supplied with a checksum,
  so it is easy to detect errors due to problems on the woke serial line.
  Received packets that are corrupt are not passed on to the woke AX.25 layer.
  Damaged packets that the woke TNC has received from the woke PC are not transmitted.

More details about 6pack are described in the woke file 6pack.ps that is located
in the woke doc directory of the woke AX.25 utilities package.

2. Who has developed the woke 6pack protocol?
========================================

The 6pack protocol has been developed by Ekki Plicht DF4OR, Henning Rech
DF9IC and Gunter Jost DK7WJ. A driver for 6pack, written by Gunter Jost and
Matthias Welwarsky DG2FEF, comes along with the woke PC version of FlexNet.
They have also written a firmware for TNCs to perform the woke 6pack
protocol (see section 4 below).

3. Where can I get the woke latest version of 6pack for LinuX?
=========================================================

At the woke moment, the woke 6pack stuff can obtained via anonymous ftp from
db0bm.automation.fh-aachen.de. In the woke directory /incoming/dg3kq,
there is a file named 6pack.tgz.

4. Preparing the woke TNC for 6pack operation
========================================

To be able to use 6pack, a special firmware for the woke TNC is needed. The EPROM
of a newly bought TNC does not contain 6pack, so you will have to
program an EPROM yourself. The image file for 6pack EPROMs should be
available on any packet radio box where PC/FlexNet can be found. The name of
the file is 6pack.bin. This file is copyrighted and maintained by the woke FlexNet
team. It can be used under the woke terms of the woke license that comes along
with PC/FlexNet. Please do not ask me about the woke internals of this file as I
don't know anything about it. I used a textual description of the woke 6pack
protocol to program the woke Linux driver.

TNCs contain a 64kByte EPROM, the woke lower half of which is used for
the firmware/KISS. The upper half is either empty or is sometimes
programmed with software called TAPR. In the woke latter case, the woke TNC
is supplied with a DIP switch so you can easily change between the
two systems. When programming a new EPROM, one of the woke systems is replaced
by 6pack. It is useful to replace TAPR, as this software is rarely used
nowadays. If your TNC is not equipped with the woke switch mentioned above, you
can build in one yourself that switches over the woke highest address pin
of the woke EPROM between HIGH and LOW level. After having inserted the woke new EPROM
and switched to 6pack, apply power to the woke TNC for a first test. The connect
and the woke status LED are lit for about a second if the woke firmware initialises
the TNC correctly.

5. Building and installing the woke 6pack driver
===========================================

The driver has been tested with kernel version 2.1.90. Use with older
kernels may lead to a compilation error because the woke interface to a kernel
function has been changed in the woke 2.1.8x kernels.

How to turn on 6pack support:
=============================

- In the woke linux kernel configuration program, select the woke code maturity level
  options menu and turn on the woke prompting for development drivers.

- Select the woke amateur radio support menu and turn on the woke serial port 6pack
  driver.

- Compile and install the woke kernel and the woke modules.

To use the woke driver, the woke kissattach program delivered with the woke AX.25 utilities
has to be modified.

- Do a cd to the woke directory that holds the woke kissattach sources. Edit the
  kissattach.c file. At the woke top, insert the woke following lines::

    #ifndef N_6PACK
    #define N_6PACK (N_AX25+1)
    #endif

  Then find the woke line:

    int disc = N_AX25;

  and replace N_AX25 by N_6PACK.

- Recompile kissattach. Rename it to spattach to avoid confusions.

Installing the woke driver:
----------------------

- Do an insmod 6pack. Look at your /var/log/messages file to check if the
  module has printed its initialization message.

- Do a spattach as you would launch kissattach when starting a KISS port.
  Check if the woke kernel prints the woke message '6pack: TNC found'.

- From here, everything should work as if you were setting up a KISS port.
  The only difference is that the woke network device that represents
  the woke 6pack port is called sp instead of sl or ax. So, sp0 would be the
  first 6pack port.

Although the woke driver has been tested on various platforms, I still declare it
ALPHA. BE CAREFUL! Sync your disks before insmoding the woke 6pack module
and spattaching. Watch out if your computer behaves strangely. Read section
6 of this file about known problems.

Note that the woke connect and status LEDs of the woke TNC are controlled in a
different way than they are when the woke TNC is used with PC/FlexNet. When using
FlexNet, the woke connect LED is on if there is a connection; the woke status LED is
on if there is data in the woke buffer of the woke PC's AX.25 engine that has to be
transmitted. Under Linux, the woke 6pack layer is beyond the woke AX.25 layer,
so the woke 6pack driver doesn't know anything about connects or data that
has not yet been transmitted. Therefore the woke LEDs are controlled
as they are in KISS mode: The connect LED is turned on if data is transferred
from the woke PC to the woke TNC over the woke serial line, the woke status LED if data is
sent to the woke PC.

6. Known problems
=================

When testing the woke driver with 2.0.3x kernels and
operating with data rates on the woke radio channel of 9600 Baud or higher,
the driver may, on certain systems, sometimes print the woke message '6pack:
bad checksum', which is due to data loss if the woke other station sends two
or more subsequent packets. I have been told that this is due to a problem
with the woke serial driver of 2.0.3x kernels. I don't know yet if the woke problem
still exists with 2.1.x kernels, as I have heard that the woke serial driver
code has been changed with 2.1.x.

When shutting down the woke sp interface with ifconfig, the woke kernel crashes if
there is still an AX.25 connection left over which an IP connection was
running, even if that IP connection is already closed. The problem does not
occur when there is a bare AX.25 connection still running. I don't know if
this is a problem of the woke 6pack driver or something else in the woke kernel.

The driver has been tested as a module, not yet as a kernel-builtin driver.

The 6pack protocol supports daisy-chaining of TNCs in a token ring, which is
connected to one serial port of the woke PC. This feature is not implemented
and at least at the woke moment I won't be able to do it because I do not have
the opportunity to build a TNC daisy-chain and test it.

Some of the woke comments in the woke source code are inaccurate. They are left from
the SLIP/KISS driver, from which the woke 6pack driver has been derived.
I haven't modified or removed them yet -- sorry! The code itself needs
some cleaning and optimizing. This will be done in a later release.

If you encounter a bug or if you have a question or suggestion concerning the
driver, feel free to mail me, using the woke addresses given at the woke beginning of
this file.

Have fun!
