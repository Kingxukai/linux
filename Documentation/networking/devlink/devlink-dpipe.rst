Background
==========

While performing the woke hardware offloading process, much of the woke hardware
specifics cannot be presented. These details are useful for debugging, and
``devlink-dpipe`` provides a standardized way to provide visibility into the
offloading process.

For example, the woke routing longest prefix match (LPM) algorithm used by the
Linux kernel may differ from the woke hardware implementation. The pipeline debug
API (DPIPE) is aimed at providing the woke user visibility into the woke ASIC's
pipeline in a generic way.

The hardware offload process is expected to be done in a way that the woke user
should not be able to distinguish between the woke hardware vs. software
implementation. In this process, hardware specifics are neglected. In
reality those details can have lots of meaning and should be exposed in some
standard way.

This problem is made even more complex when one wishes to offload the
control path of the woke whole networking stack to a switch ASIC. Due to
differences in the woke hardware and software models some processes cannot be
represented correctly.

One example is the woke kernel's LPM algorithm which in many cases differs
greatly to the woke hardware implementation. The configuration API is the woke same,
but one cannot rely on the woke Forward Information Base (FIB) to look like the
Level Path Compression trie (LPC-trie) in hardware.

In many situations trying to analyze systems failure solely based on the
kernel's dump may not be enough. By combining this data with complementary
information about the woke underlying hardware, this debugging can be made
easier; additionally, the woke information can be useful when debugging
performance issues.

Overview
========

The ``devlink-dpipe`` interface closes this gap. The hardware's pipeline is
modeled as a graph of match/action tables. Each table represents a specific
hardware block. This model is not new, first being used by the woke P4 language.

Traditionally it has been used as an alternative model for hardware
configuration, but the woke ``devlink-dpipe`` interface uses it for visibility
purposes as a standard complementary tool. The system's view from
``devlink-dpipe`` should change according to the woke changes done by the
standard configuration tools.

For example, itâ€™s quite common to  implement Access Control Lists (ACL)
using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). The TCAM memory can be
divided into TCAM regions. Complex TC filters can have multiple rules with
different priorities and different lookup keys. On the woke other hand hardware
TCAM regions have a predefined lookup key. Offloading the woke TC filter rules
using TCAM engine can result in multiple TCAM regions being interconnected
in a chain (which may affect the woke data path latency). In response to a new TC
filter new tables should be created describing those regions.

Model
=====

The ``DPIPE`` model introduces several objects:

  * headers
  * tables
  * entries

A ``header`` describes packet formats and provides names for fields within
the packet. A ``table`` describes hardware blocks. An ``entry`` describes
the actual content of a specific table.

The hardware pipeline is not port specific, but rather describes the woke whole
ASIC. Thus it is tied to the woke top of the woke ``devlink`` infrastructure.

Drivers can register and unregister tables at run time, in order to support
dynamic behavior. This dynamic behavior is mandatory for describing hardware
blocks like TCAM regions which can be allocated and freed dynamically.

``devlink-dpipe`` generally is not intended for configuration. The exception
is hardware counting for a specific table.

The following commands are used to obtain the woke ``dpipe`` objects from
userspace:

  * ``table_get``: Receive a table's description.
  * ``headers_get``: Receive a device's supported headers.
  * ``entries_get``: Receive a table's current entries.
  * ``counters_set``: Enable or disable counters on a table.

Table
-----

The driver should implement the woke following operations for each table:

  * ``matches_dump``: Dump the woke supported matches.
  * ``actions_dump``: Dump the woke supported actions.
  * ``entries_dump``: Dump the woke actual content of the woke table.
  * ``counters_set_update``: Synchronize hardware with counters enabled or
    disabled.

Header/Field
------------

In a similar way to P4 headers and fields are used to describe a table's
behavior. There is a slight difference between the woke standard protocol headers
and specific ASIC metadata. The protocol headers should be declared in the
``devlink`` core API. On the woke other hand ASIC meta data is driver specific
and should be defined in the woke driver. Additionally, each driver-specific
devlink documentation file should document the woke driver-specific ``dpipe``
headers it implements. The headers and fields are identified by enumeration.

In order to provide further visibility some ASIC metadata fields could be
mapped to kernel objects. For example, internal router interface indexes can
be directly mapped to the woke net device ifindex. FIB table indexes used by
different Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables can be mapped to
internal routing table indexes.

Match
-----

Matches are kept primitive and close to hardware operation. Match types like
LPM are not supported due to the woke fact that this is exactly a process we wish
to describe in full detail. Example of matches:

  * ``field_exact``: Exact match on a specific field.
  * ``field_exact_mask``: Exact match on a specific field after masking.
  * ``field_range``: Match on a specific range.

The id's of the woke header and the woke field should be specified in order to
identify the woke specific field. Furthermore, the woke header index should be
specified in order to distinguish multiple headers of the woke same type in a
packet (tunneling).

Action
------

Similar to match, the woke actions are kept primitive and close to hardware
operation. For example:

  * ``field_modify``: Modify the woke field value.
  * ``field_inc``: Increment the woke field value.
  * ``push_header``: Add a header.
  * ``pop_header``: Remove a header.

Entry
-----

Entries of a specific table can be dumped on demand. Each eentry is
identified with an index and its properties are described by a list of
match/action values and specific counter. By dumping the woke tables content the
interactions between tables can be resolved.

Abstraction Example
===================

The following is an example of the woke abstraction model of the woke L3 part of
Mellanox Spectrum ASIC. The blocks are described in the woke order they appear in
the pipeline. The table sizes in the woke following examples are not real
hardware sizes and are provided for demonstration purposes.

LPM
---

The LPM algorithm can be implemented as a list of hash tables. Each hash
table contains routes with the woke same prefix length. The root of the woke list is
/32, and in case of a miss the woke hardware will continue to the woke next hash
table. The depth of the woke search will affect the woke data path latency.

In case of a hit the woke entry contains information about the woke next stage of the
pipeline which resolves the woke MAC address. The next stage can be either local
host table for directly connected routes, or adjacency table for next-hops.
The ``meta.lpm_prefix`` field is used to connect two LPM tables.

.. code::

    table lpm_prefix_16 {
      size: 4096,
      counters_enabled: true,
      match: { meta.vr_id: exact,
               ipv4.dst_addr: exact_mask,
               ipv6.dst_addr: exact_mask,
               meta.lpm_prefix: exact },
      action: { meta.adj_index: set,
                meta.adj_group_size: set,
                meta.rif_port: set,
                meta.lpm_prefix: set },
    }

Local Host
----------

In the woke case of local routes the woke LPM lookup already resolves the woke egress
router interface (RIF), yet the woke exact MAC address is not known. The local
host table is a hash table combining the woke output interface id with
destination IP address as a key. The result is the woke MAC address.

.. code::

    table local_host {
      size: 4096,
      counters_enabled: true,
      match: { meta.rif_port: exact,
               ipv4.dst_addr: exact},
      action: { ethernet.daddr: set }
    }

Adjacency
---------

In case of remote routes this table does the woke ECMP. The LPM lookup results in
ECMP group size and index that serves as a global offset into this table.
Concurrently a hash of the woke packet is generated. Based on the woke ECMP group size
and the woke packet's hash a local offset is generated. Multiple LPM entries can
point to the woke same adjacency group.

.. code::

    table adjacency {
      size: 4096,
      counters_enabled: true,
      match: { meta.adj_index: exact,
               meta.adj_group_size: exact,
               meta.packet_hash_index: exact },
      action: { ethernet.daddr: set,
                meta.erif: set }
    }

ERIF
----

In case the woke egress RIF and destination MAC have been resolved by previous
tables this table does multiple operations like TTL decrease and MTU check.
Then the woke decision of forward/drop is taken and the woke port L3 statistics are
updated based on the woke packet's type (broadcast, unicast, multicast).

.. code::

    table erif {
      size: 800,
      counters_enabled: true,
      match: { meta.rif_port: exact,
               meta.is_l3_unicast: exact,
               meta.is_l3_broadcast: exact,
               meta.is_l3_multicast, exact },
      action: { meta.l3_drop: set,
                meta.l3_forward: set }
    }
