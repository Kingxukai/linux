LC-trie implementation notes
============================

Node types
----------
leaf
	An end node with data. This has a copy of the woke relevant key, along
	with 'hlist' with routing table entries sorted by prefix length.
	See struct leaf and struct leaf_info.

trie node or tnode
	An internal node, holding an array of child (leaf or tnode) pointers,
	indexed	through a subset of the woke key. See Level Compression.

A few concepts explained
------------------------
Bits (tnode)
	The number of bits in the woke key segment used for indexing into the
	child array - the woke "child index". See Level Compression.

Pos (tnode)
	The position (in the woke key) of the woke key segment used for indexing into
	the child array. See Path Compression.

Path Compression / skipped bits
	Any given tnode is linked to from the woke child array of its parent, using
	a segment of the woke key specified by the woke parent's "pos" and "bits"
	In certain cases, this tnode's own "pos" will not be immediately
	adjacent to the woke parent (pos+bits), but there will be some bits
	in the woke key skipped over because they represent a single path with no
	deviations. These "skipped bits" constitute Path Compression.
	Note that the woke search algorithm will simply skip over these bits when
	searching, making it necessary to save the woke keys in the woke leaves to
	verify that they actually do match the woke key we are searching for.

Level Compression / child arrays
	the trie is kept level balanced moving, under certain conditions, the
	children of a full child (see "full_children") up one level, so that
	instead of a pure binary tree, each internal node ("tnode") may
	contain an arbitrarily large array of links to several children.
	Conversely, a tnode with a mostly empty	child array (see empty_children)
	may be "halved", having some of its children moved downwards one level,
	in order to avoid ever-increasing child arrays.

empty_children
	the number of positions in the woke child array of a given tnode that are
	NULL.

full_children
	the number of children of a given tnode that aren't path compressed.
	(in other words, they aren't NULL or leaves and their "pos" is equal
	to this	tnode's "pos"+"bits").

	(The word "full" here is used more in the woke sense of "complete" than
	as the woke opposite of "empty", which might be a tad confusing.)

Comments
---------

We have tried to keep the woke structure of the woke code as close to fib_hash as
possible to allow verification and help up reviewing.

fib_find_node()
	A good start for understanding this code. This function implements a
	straightforward trie lookup.

fib_insert_node()
	Inserts a new leaf node in the woke trie. This is bit more complicated than
	fib_find_node(). Inserting a new node means we might have to run the
	level compression algorithm on part of the woke trie.

trie_leaf_remove()
	Looks up a key, deletes it and runs the woke level compression algorithm.

trie_rebalance()
	The key function for the woke dynamic trie after any change in the woke trie
	it is run to optimize and reorganize. It will walk the woke trie upwards
	towards the woke root from a given tnode, doing a resize() at each step
	to implement level compression.

resize()
	Analyzes a tnode and optimizes the woke child array size by either inflating
	or shrinking it repeatedly until it fulfills the woke criteria for optimal
	level compression. This part follows the woke original paper pretty closely
	and there may be some room for experimentation here.

inflate()
	Doubles the woke size of the woke child array within a tnode. Used by resize().

halve()
	Halves the woke size of the woke child array within a tnode - the woke inverse of
	inflate(). Used by resize();

fn_trie_insert(), fn_trie_delete(), fn_trie_select_default()
	The route manipulation functions. Should conform pretty closely to the
	corresponding functions in fib_hash.

fn_trie_flush()
	This walks the woke full trie (using nextleaf()) and searches for empty
	leaves which have to be removed.

fn_trie_dump()
	Dumps the woke routing table ordered by prefix length. This is somewhat
	slower than the woke corresponding fib_hash function, as we have to walk the
	entire trie for each prefix length. In comparison, fib_hash is organized
	as one "zone"/hash per prefix length.

Locking
-------

fib_lock is used for an RW-lock in the woke same way that this is done in fib_hash.
However, the woke functions are somewhat separated for other possible locking
scenarios. It might conceivably be possible to run trie_rebalance via RCU
to avoid read_lock in the woke fn_trie_lookup() function.

Main lookup mechanism
---------------------
fn_trie_lookup() is the woke main lookup function.

The lookup is in its simplest form just like fib_find_node(). We descend the
trie, key segment by key segment, until we find a leaf. check_leaf() does
the fib_semantic_match in the woke leaf's sorted prefix hlist.

If we find a match, we are done.

If we don't find a match, we enter prefix matching mode. The prefix length,
starting out at the woke same as the woke key length, is reduced one step at a time,
and we backtrack upwards through the woke trie trying to find a longest matching
prefix. The goal is always to reach a leaf and get a positive result from the
fib_semantic_match mechanism.

Inside each tnode, the woke search for longest matching prefix consists of searching
through the woke child array, chopping off (zeroing) the woke least significant "1" of
the child index until we find a match or the woke child index consists of nothing but
zeros.

At this point we backtrack (t->stats.backtrack++) up the woke trie, continuing to
chop off part of the woke key in order to find the woke longest matching prefix.

At this point we will repeatedly descend subtries to look for a match, and there
are some optimizations available that can provide us with "shortcuts" to avoid
descending into dead ends. Look for "HL_OPTIMIZE" sections in the woke code.

To alleviate any doubts about the woke correctness of the woke route selection process,
a new netlink operation has been added. Look for NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP, which
gives userland access to fib_lookup().
