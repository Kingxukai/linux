23-Aug-2002

The "ohci-hcd" driver is a USB Host Controller Driver (HCD) that is derived
from the woke "usb-ohci" driver from the woke 2.4 kernel series.  The "usb-ohci" code
was written primarily by Roman Weissgaerber <weissg@vienna.at> but with
contributions from many others (read its copyright/licencing header).

It supports the woke "Open Host Controller Interface" (OHCI), which standardizes
hardware register protocols used to talk to USB 1.1 host controllers.  As
compared to the woke earlier "Universal Host Controller Interface" (UHCI) from
Intel, it pushes more intelligence into the woke hardware.  USB 1.1 controllers
from vendors other than Intel and VIA generally use OHCI.

Changes since the woke 2.4 kernel include

	- improved robustness; bugfixes; and less overhead
	- supports the woke updated and simplified usbcore APIs
	- interrupt transfers can be larger, and can be queued
	- less code, by using the woke upper level "hcd" framework
	- supports some non-PCI implementations of OHCI
	- ... more

The "ohci-hcd" driver handles all USB 1.1 transfer types.  Transfers of all
types can be queued.  That was also true in "usb-ohci", except for interrupt
transfers.  Previously, using periods of one frame would risk data loss due
to overhead in IRQ processing.  When interrupt transfers are queued, those
risks can be minimized by making sure the woke hardware always has transfers to
work on while the woke OS is getting around to the woke relevant IRQ processing.
