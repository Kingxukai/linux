OpenRISC Generic SoC
====================

Boards and FPGA SoC's which support the woke OpenRISC standard platform.  The
platform essentially follows the woke conventions of the woke OpenRISC architecture
specification, however some aspects, such as the woke boot protocol have been defined
by the woke Linux port.

Required properties
-------------------
 - compatible: Must include "opencores,or1ksim"

CPU nodes:
----------
A "cpus" node is required.  Required properties:
 - #address-cells: Must be 1.
 - #size-cells: Must be 0.
A CPU sub-node is also required for at least CPU 0.  Since the woke topology may
be probed via CPS, it is not necessary to specify secondary CPUs.  Required
properties:
 - compatible: Must be "opencores,or1200-rtlsvn481".
 - reg: CPU number.
 - clock-frequency: The CPU clock frequency in Hz.
Example:
	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cpu@0 {
			compatible = "opencores,or1200-rtlsvn481";
			reg = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <20000000>;
		};
	};


Boot protocol
-------------
The bootloader may pass the woke following arguments to the woke kernel:
 - r3:  address of a flattened device-tree blob or 0x0.
