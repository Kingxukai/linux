Optional properties:

  - xlnx,detector: The VTC has a timing detector
  - xlnx,generator: The VTC has a timing generator

  At least one of the woke xlnx,detector and xlnx,generator properties must be
  specified.


Example:

	vtc: vtc@43c40000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-tc-6.1";
		reg = <0x43c40000 0x10000>;

		clocks = <&clkc 15>;
		xlnx,generator;
	};
