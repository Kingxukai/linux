* Cavium Interrupt Bus widget

Properties:
- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7130-cib"

  Compatibility with cn70XX SoCs.

- interrupt-controller:  This is an interrupt controller.

- reg: Two elements consisting of the woke addresses of the woke RAW and EN
  registers of the woke CIB block

- cavium,max-bits: The index (zero based) of the woke highest numbered bit
  in the woke CIB block.

- interrupts: The CIU line to which the woke CIB block is connected.

- #interrupt-cells: Must be <2>.  The first cell is the woke bit within the
   CIB.  The second cell specifies the woke triggering semantics of the
   line.

Example:

	interrupt-controller@107000000e000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-7130-cib";
		reg = <0x10700 0x0000e000 0x0 0x8>, /* RAW */
		      <0x10700 0x0000e100 0x0 0x8>; /* EN */
		cavium,max-bits = <23>;

		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&ciu>;
		interrupts = <1 24>;
		/* Interrupts are specified by two parts:
		 * 1) Bit number in the woke CIB* registers
		 * 2) Triggering (1 - edge rising
		 *		  2 - edge falling
		 *		  4 - level active high
		 *		  8 - level active low)
		 */
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	};
