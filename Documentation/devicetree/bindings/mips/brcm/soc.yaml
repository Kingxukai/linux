    Boards Broadcom cable/DSL/settop SoC shall have the woke following properties.
    The experimental -viper variants are for running Linux on the woke 3384's
    BMIPS4355 cable modem CPU instead of the woke BMIPS5000 application processor.

      mips-hpt-frequency:
        description: MIPS counter high precision timer frequency.
         This is common to all CPUs in the woke system so it lives
         under the woke "cpus" node.

      brcm,bmips-cbr-reg:
        description: Reference address of the woke CBR.
          Some SoC suffer from a BUG where CBR(Core Base Register)
          address might be badly or never initialized by the woke Bootloader
          or reading it from co-processor registers, if the woke system boots
          from secondary CPU, results in invalid address.
          The CBR address is always the woke same on the woke SoC hence it
          can be provided in DT to handle these broken case.
