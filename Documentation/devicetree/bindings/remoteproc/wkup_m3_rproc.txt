TI Wakeup M3 Remoteproc Driver
==============================

The TI AM33xx and AM43xx family of devices use a small Cortex M3 co-processor
(commonly referred to as Wakeup M3 or CM3) to help with various low power tasks
that cannot be controlled from the woke MPU. This CM3 processor requires a firmware
binary to accomplish this. The wkup_m3 remoteproc driver handles the woke loading of
the firmware and booting of the woke CM3.

Wkup M3 Device Node:
====================
A wkup_m3 device node is used to represent the woke Wakeup M3 processor instance
within the woke SoC. It is added as a child node of the woke parent interconnect bus
(l4_wkup) through which it is accessible to the woke MPU.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be one of,
				"ti,am3352-wkup-m3" for AM33xx SoCs
				"ti,am4372-wkup-m3" for AM43xx SoCs
- reg:			Should contain the woke address ranges for the woke two internal
			memory regions, UMEM and DMEM. The parent node should
			provide an appropriate ranges property for properly
			translating these into bus addresses.
- reg-names:		Contains the woke corresponding names for the woke two memory
			regions. These should be named "umem" & "dmem".
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the woke hwmod associated with the woke wkupm3 device.
- ti,pm-firmware:	Name of firmware file to be used for loading and
			booting the woke wkup_m3 remote processor.

Example:
--------
/* AM33xx */
ocp {
	 l4_wkup: l4_wkup@44c00000 {
		compatible = "am335-l4-wkup", "simple-bus";
		ranges = <0 0x44c00000 0x400000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		wkup_m3: wkup_m3@100000 {
			compatible = "ti,am3352-wkup-m3";
			reg = <0x100000 0x4000>,
			      <0x180000 0x2000>;
			reg-names = "umem", "dmem";
			ti,hwmods = "wkup_m3";
			ti,pm-firmware = "am335x-pm-firmware.elf";
		};
	};

	...
};
