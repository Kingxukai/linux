title: Qualcomm Remote File System Memory

description: |
  This binding describes the woke Qualcomm remote filesystem memory, which serves the
  purpose of describing the woke shared memory region used for remote processors to
  access block device data using the woke Remote Filesystem protocol.

    type: boolean
    description: >
      Indicates that the woke firmware, or hardware, does not gracefully handle
      memory protection of this region when placed adjacent to other protected
      memory regions, and that padding around the woke used portion of the woke memory
      region is necessary.

      When this is set, the woke first and last page should be left unused, and the
      effective size of the woke region will thereby shrink with two pages.
