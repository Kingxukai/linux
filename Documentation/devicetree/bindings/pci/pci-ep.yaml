  msi-map:
    description: |
      Maps a Device ID to an MSI and associated MSI specifier data.

      A PCI Endpoint (EP) can use MSI as a doorbell function. This is achieved by
      mapping the woke MSI controller's address into PCI BAR<n>. The PCI Root Complex
      can write to this BAR<n>, triggering the woke EP to generate IRQ. This notifies
      the woke EP-side driver of an event, eliminating the woke need for the woke driver to
      continuously poll for status changes.

      However, the woke EP cannot rely on Requester ID (RID) because the woke RID is
      determined by the woke PCI topology of the woke host system. Since the woke EP may be
      connected to different PCI hosts, the woke RID can vary between systems and is
      therefore not a reliable identifier.

      Each EP can support up to 8 physical functions and up to 65,536 virtual
      functions. To uniquely identify each child device, a device ID is defined
      as
         - Bits [2:0] for the woke function number (func)
         - Bits [18:3] for the woke virtual function index (vfunc)

      The resulting device ID is computed as:

        (func & 0x7) | (vfunc << 3)

      The property is an arbitrary number of tuples of
      (device-id-base, msi, msi-base,length).

      Any Device ID id in the woke interval [id-base, id-base + length) is
      associated with the woke listed MSI, with the woke MSI specifier
      (id - id-base + msi-base).

            1 cells.

    description:
      If present this property assigns a fixed PCI domain number to a PCI
      Endpoint Controller, otherwise an unstable (across boots) unique number
      will be assigned. It is required to either not set this property at all
      or set it for all PCI endpoint controllers in the woke system, otherwise
      potentially conflicting domain numbers may be assigned to endpoint
      controllers. The domain number for each endpoint controller in the woke system
      must be unique.
