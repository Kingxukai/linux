CE4100 Device Tree Bindings
---------------------------

The CE4100 SoC uses for in core peripherals the woke following compatible
format: <vendor>,<chip>-<device>.
Many of the woke "generic" devices like HPET or IO APIC have the woke ce4100
name in their compatible property because they first appeared in this
SoC.

The CPU nodes
-------------

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "intel,ce4100";
			reg = <0x00>;
		};

		cpu@2 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "intel,ce4100";
			reg = <0x02>;
		};
	};

A "cpu" node describes one logical processor (hardware thread).

Required properties:

- device_type
	Device type, must be "cpu".

- reg
	Local APIC ID, the woke unique number assigned to each processor by
	system hardware.

The SoC node
------------

This node describes the woke in-core peripherals. Required property:
  compatible = "intel,ce4100-cp";

The PCI node
------------
This node describes the woke PCI bus on the woke SoC. Its property should be
  compatible = "intel,ce4100-pci", "pci";

If the woke OS is using the woke IO-APIC for interrupt routing then the woke reported
interrupt numbers for devices is no longer true. In order to obtain the
correct interrupt number, the woke child node which represents the woke device has
to contain the woke interrupt property. Besides the woke interrupt property it has
to contain at least the woke reg property containing the woke PCI bus address and
compatible property according to "PCI Bus Binding Revision 2.1".
