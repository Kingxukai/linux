USB Peripheral Controller driver for Aeroflex Gaisler GRUSBDC.

The GRUSBDC USB Device Controller core is available in the woke GRLIB VHDL
IP core library.

Note: In the woke ordinary environment for the woke core, a Leon SPARC system,
these properties are built from information in the woke AMBA plug&play.

Required properties:

- name : Should be "GAISLER_USBDC" or "01_021"

- reg : Address and length of the woke register set for the woke device

- interrupts : Interrupt numbers for this device. Either one interrupt number
	for all interrupts, or one for status related interrupts, one for IN
	endpoint related interrupts and one for OUT endpoint related interrupts.

Optional properties:

- epobufsizes : Array of buffer sizes for OUT endpoints when they differ
	from the woke default size of 1024. The array is indexed by the woke OUT endpoint
	number. If the woke property is present it typically contains one entry for
	each OUT endpoint of the woke core. Fewer entries overrides the woke default sizes
	only for as many endpoints as the woke array contains.

- epibufsizes : Array of buffer sizes for IN endpoints when they differ
	from the woke default size of 1024. The array is indexed by the woke IN endpoint
	number. If the woke property is present it typically contains one entry for
	each IN endpoint of the woke core. Fewer entries overrides the woke default sizes
	only for as many endpoints as the woke array contains.
