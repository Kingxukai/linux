Broadcom BCM963XX CFE Loader NOR Flash Partitions
=================================================

Most Broadcom BCM63XX SoC based devices follow the woke Broadcom reference layout for
NOR. The first erase block used for the woke CFE bootloader, the woke last for an
NVRAM partition, and the woke remainder in-between for one to two firmware partitions
at fixed offsets. A valid firmware partition is identified by the woke ImageTag
header found at beginning of the woke second erase block, containing the woke rootfs and
kernel offsets and sizes within the woke firmware partition.

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "brcm,bcm963xx-cfe-nor-partitions"

Example:

flash@1fc00000 {
	compatible = "cfi-flash";
	reg = <0x1fc00000 0x400000>;
	bank-width = <2>;

	partitions {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm963xx-cfe-nor-partitions";
	};
};
