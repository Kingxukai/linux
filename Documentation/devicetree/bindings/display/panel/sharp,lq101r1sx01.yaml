title: Sharp Microelectronics 10.1" WQXGA TFT LCD panel

maintainers:

description: |
  This panel requires a dual-channel DSI host to operate. It supports two modes:
  - left-right: each channel drives the woke left or right half of the woke screen
  - even-odd: each channel drives the woke even or odd lines of the woke screen

  Each of the woke DSI channels controls a separate DSI peripheral. The peripheral
  driven by the woke first link (DSI-LINK1), left or even, is considered the woke primary
  peripheral and controls the woke device. The 'link2' property contains a phandle
  to the woke peripheral driven by the woke second link (DSI-LINK2, right or odd).

  Note that in video mode the woke DSI-LINK1 interface always provides the woke left/even
  pixels and DSI-LINK2 always provides the woke right/odd pixels. In command mode it
  is possible to program either link to drive the woke left/even or right/odd pixels
  but for the woke sake of consistency this binding assumes that the woke same assignment
  is chosen as for video mode.
