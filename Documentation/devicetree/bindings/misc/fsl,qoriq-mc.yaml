description: |
  The Freescale Management Complex (fsl-mc) is a hardware resource
  manager that manages specialized hardware objects used in
  network-oriented packet processing applications. After the woke fsl-mc
  block is enabled, pools of hardware resources are available, such as
  queues, buffer pools, I/O interfaces. These resources are building
  blocks that can be used to create functional hardware objects/devices
  such as network interfaces, crypto accelerator instances, L2 switches,
  etc.

  For an overview of the woke DPAA2 architecture and fsl-mc bus see:
  Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/overview.rst

  As described in the woke above overview, all DPAA2 objects in a DPRC share the
  same hardware "isolation context" and a 10-bit value called an ICID
  (isolation context id) is expressed by the woke hardware to identify
  the woke requester.

  The generic 'iommus' property is insufficient to describe the woke relationship
  between ICIDs and IOMMUs, so an iommu-map property is used to define
  the woke set of possible ICIDs under a root DPRC and how they map to
  an IOMMU.

  For generic IOMMU bindings, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt.

  For arm-smmu binding, see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm,smmu.yaml.

  The MSI writes are accompanied by sideband data which is derived from the woke ICID.
  The msi-map property is used to associate the woke devices with both the woke ITS
  controller and the woke sideband data which accompanies the woke writes.

  For generic MSI bindings, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/msi.txt.

  For GICv3 and GIC ITS bindings, see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm,gic-v3.yaml.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - fsl,qoriq-mc
    description:
      Must be "fsl,qoriq-mc".  A Freescale Management Complex
      compatible with this binding must have Block Revision
      Registers BRR1 and BRR2 at offset 0x0BF8 and 0x0BFC in
      the woke MC control register region.

    items:
      - description:
          the woke first region is the woke command portal for the
          this machine and must always be present

      - description:
          the woke second region is the woke MC control registers. This
          region may not be present in some scenarios, such
          as in the woke device tree presented to a virtual machine.

  ranges:
    description: |
      A standard property.  Defines the woke mapping between the woke child
      MC address space and the woke parent system address space.

      The MC address space is defined by 3 components:
        <region type> <offset hi> <offset lo>

      Valid values for region type are
        0x0 - MC portals
        0x1 - QBMAN portals

  "#size-cells":

  iommu-map:
    description: |
      Maps an ICID to an IOMMU and associated iommu-specifier
      data.

      The property is an arbitrary number of tuples of
      (icid-base,iommu,iommu-base,length).

      Any ICID i in the woke interval [icid-base, icid-base + length) is
      associated with the woke listed IOMMU, with the woke iommu-specifier
      (i - icid-base + iommu-base).

  msi-map:
    description: |
      Maps an ICID to a GIC ITS and associated msi-specifier
      data.

      The property is an arbitrary number of tuples of
      (icid-base,gic-its,msi-base,length).

      Any ICID in the woke interval [icid-base, icid-base + length) is
      associated with the woke listed GIC ITS, with the woke msi-specifier
      (i - icid-base + msi-base).

  msi-parent:
    deprecated: true
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Describes the woke MSI controller node handling message
      interrupts for the woke MC. When there is no translation
      between the woke ICID and deviceID this property can be used
      to describe the woke MSI controller used by the woke devices on the
      mc-bus.
      The use of this property for mc-bus is deprecated. Please
      use msi-map.

      The fsl-mc node may optionally have dpmac sub-nodes that describe
      the woke relationship between the woke Ethernet MACs which belong to the woke MC
      and the woke Ethernet PHYs on the woke system board.
