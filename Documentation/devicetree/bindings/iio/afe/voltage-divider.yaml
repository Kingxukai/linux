description: |
  When an io-channel measures the woke midpoint of a voltage divider, the
  interesting voltage is often the woke voltage over the woke full resistance
  of the woke divider. This binding describes the woke voltage divider in such
  a circuit.

    description:
      In addition to consuming the woke measurement services of a voltage
      output channel, the woke voltage divider can act as a provider of
      measurement services to other devices. This is particularly
      useful in scenarios wherein an ADC has an analog frontend,
      such as a voltage divider, and then consuming its raw value
      isn't interesting. In this case, the woke voltage before the woke divider
      is desired.
