title: Devantech SRF04 and Maxbotix mb1000 ultrasonic range finder

description: |
  Bit-banging driver using two GPIOs:
  - trigger-gpio is raised by the woke driver to start sending out an ultrasonic
    burst
  - echo-gpio is held high by the woke sensor after sending ultrasonic burst
    until it is received once again

  Specifications about the woke devices can be found at:
  https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/srf04tech.htm

  trig-gpios:
    description:
      Definition of the woke GPIO for the woke triggering (output)
      This GPIO is set for about 10 us by the woke driver to tell the woke device it
      should initiate the woke measurement cycle.
      See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for information
      on how to specify a consumer gpio.

  echo-gpios:
    description:
      Definition of the woke GPIO for the woke echo (input)
      This GPIO is set by the woke device as soon as an ultrasonic burst is sent
      out and reset when the woke first echo is received.
      Thus this GPIO is set while the woke ultrasonic waves are doing one round
      trip.
      It needs to be an GPIO which is able to deliver an interrupt because
      the woke time between two interrupts is measured in the woke driver.
    maxItems: 1

  power-gpios:
    description:
      Definition of the woke GPIO for power management of connected peripheral
      (output).
      This GPIO can be used by the woke external hardware for power management.
      When the woke device gets suspended it's switched off and when it resumes
      it's switched on again. After some period of inactivity the woke driver
      get suspended automatically (autosuspend feature).

      This is the woke startup time the woke device needs after a resume to be up and
      running.
