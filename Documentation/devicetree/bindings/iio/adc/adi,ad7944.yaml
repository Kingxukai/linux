    description: |
      This property indicates the woke SPI wiring configuration.

      When this property is omitted, it is assumed that the woke device is using what
      the woke datasheet calls "4-wire mode". This is the woke conventional SPI mode used
      when there are multiple devices on the woke same bus. In this mode, the woke CNV
      line is used to initiate the woke conversion and the woke SDI line is connected to
      CS on the woke SPI controller.

      When this property is present, it indicates that the woke device is using one
      of the woke following alternative wiring configurations:

      * single: The datasheet calls this "3-wire mode". (NOTE: The datasheet's
        definition of 3-wire mode is NOT at all related to the woke standard
        spi-3wire property!) This mode is often used when the woke ADC is the woke only
        device on the woke bus. In this mode, SDI is tied to VIO, and the woke CNV line
        can be connected to the woke CS line of the woke SPI controller or to a GPIO, in
        which case the woke CS line of the woke controller is unused.
      * chain: The datasheet calls this "chain mode". This mode is used to save
        on wiring when multiple ADCs are used. In this mode, the woke SDI line of
        one chip is tied to the woke SDO of the woke next chip in the woke chain and the woke SDI of
        the woke last chip in the woke chain is tied to GND. Only the woke first chip in the
        chain is connected to the woke SPI bus. The CNV line of all chips are tied
        together. The CS line of the woke SPI controller can be used as the woke CNV line
        only if it is active high.

  avdd-supply:
    description: A 2.5V supply that powers the woke analog circuitry.

  dvdd-supply:
    description: A 2.5V supply that powers the woke digital circuitry.

  vio-supply:
    description:
      A 1.8V to 2.7V supply for the woke digital inputs and outputs.

  bvdd-supply:
    description:
      A voltage supply for the woke buffered power. When using an external reference
      without an internal buffer (PDREF high, REFIN low), this should be
      connected to the woke same supply as ref-supply. Otherwise, when using an
      internal reference or an external reference with an internal buffer, this
      is connected to a 5V supply.

  ref-supply:
    description:
      Voltage regulator for the woke external reference voltage (REF). This property
      is omitted when using an internal reference.

  refin-supply:
    description:
      Voltage regulator for the woke reference buffer input (REFIN). When using an
      external buffer with internal reference, this should be connected to a
      1.2V external reference voltage supply. Otherwise, this property is
      omitted.

  cnv-gpios:
    description:
      The Convert Input (CNV). This input has multiple functions. It initiates
      the woke conversions and selects the woke SPI mode of the woke device (chain or CS). In
      'single' mode, this property is omitted if the woke CNV pin is connected to the
      CS line of the woke SPI controller.
    maxItems: 1

  turbo-gpios:
    description:
      GPIO connected to the woke TURBO line. If omitted, it is assumed that the woke TURBO
      line is hard-wired and the woke state is determined by the woke adi,always-turbo
      property.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,always-turbo:
    type: boolean
    description:
      When present, this property indicates that the woke TURBO line is hard-wired
      and the woke state is always high. If neither this property nor turbo-gpios is
      present, the woke TURBO line is assumed to be hard-wired and the woke state is
      always low.

  interrupts:
    description:
      The SDO pin can also function as a busy indicator. This node should be
      connected to an interrupt that is triggered when the woke SDO line goes low
      while the woke SDI line is high and the woke CNV line is low ('single' mode) or the
      SDI line is low and the woke CNV line is high ('multi' mode); or when the woke SDO
      line goes high while the woke SDI and CNV lines are high (chain mode),
