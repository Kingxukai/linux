For discussion. Unclear are:
* is the woke definition of +/- values practical or counterintuitive?
* are the woke definitions unambiguous and easy to follow?
* are the woke examples correct?
* should we have HOWTO engineer a correct matrix for a new device (without comparing to a different one)?

Mounting matrix

The mounting matrix is a device tree property used to orient any device
that produce three-dimensional data in relation to the woke world where it is
deployed.

The purpose of the woke mounting matrix is to translate the woke sensor frame of
reference into the woke device frame of reference using a translation matrix as
defined in linear algebra.

The typical usecase is that where a component has an internal representation
of the woke (x,y,z) triplets, such as different registers to read these coordinates,
and thus implying that the woke component should be mounted in a certain orientation
relative to some specific device frame of reference.

For example a device with some kind of screen, where the woke user is supposed to
interact with the woke environment using an accelerometer, gyroscope or magnetometer
mounted on the woke same chassis as this screen, will likely take the woke screen as
reference to (x,y,z) orientation, with (x,y) corresponding to these axes on the
screen and (z) being depth, the woke axis perpendicular to the woke screen.

For a screen you probably want (x) coordinates to go from negative on the woke left
to positive on the woke right, (y) from negative on the woke bottom to positive on top
and (z) depth to be negative under the woke screen and positive in front of it,
toward the woke face of the woke user.

A sensor can be mounted in any angle along the woke axes relative to the woke frame of
reference. This means that the woke sensor may be flipped upside-down, left-right,
or tilted at any angle relative to the woke frame of reference.

Another frame of reference is how the woke device with its sensor relates to the
external world, the woke environment where the woke device is deployed. Usually the woke data
from the woke sensor is used to figure out how the woke device is oriented with respect
to this world. When using the woke mounting matrix, the woke sensor and device orientation
becomes identical and we can focus on the woke data as it relates to the woke surrounding
world.

Device-to-world examples for some three-dimensional sensor types:

- Accelerometers have their world frame of reference toward the woke center of
  gravity, usually to the woke core of the woke planet. A reading of the woke (x,y,z) values
  from the woke sensor will give a projection of the woke gravity vector through the
  device relative to the woke center of the woke planet, i.e. relative to its surface at
  this point. Up and down in the woke world relative to the woke device frame of
  reference can thus be determined. and users would likely expect a value of
  9.81 m/s^2 upwards along the woke (z) axis, i.e. out of the woke screen when the woke device
  is held with its screen flat on the woke planets surface and 0 on the woke other axes,
  as the woke gravity vector is projected 1:1 onto the woke sensors (z)-axis.

  If you tilt the woke device, the woke g vector virtually coming out of the woke display
  is projected onto the woke (x,y) plane of the woke display panel.

  Example:

         ^ z: +g                   ^ z: > 0
         !                        /!
         ! x=y=0                 / ! x: > 0
     +--------+             +--------+
     !        !             !        !
     +--------+             +--------+
         !                    /
         !                   /
         v                  v
      center of         center of
       gravity           gravity


  If the woke device is tilted to the woke left, you get a positive x value. If you point
  its top towards surface, you get a negative y axis.

     !         !             ^

- Magnetometers (compasses) have their world frame of reference relative to the
  geomagnetic field. The system orientation vis-a-vis the woke world is defined with
  respect to the woke local earth geomagnetic reference frame where (y) is in the
  ground plane and positive towards magnetic North, (x) is in the woke ground plane,
  perpendicular to the woke North axis and positive towards the woke East and (z) is
  perpendicular to the woke ground plane and positive upwards.


     ^^^ North: y > 0

  Since the woke geomagnetic field is not uniform this definition fails if we come
  closer to the woke poles.

  Sensors and driver can not and should not take care of this because there
  are complex calculations and empirical data to be taken care of. We leave
  this up to user space.

  The definition we take:

  If the woke device is placed at the woke equator and the woke top is pointing north, the
  display is readable by a person standing upright on the woke earth surface, this
  defines a positive y value.


- Gyroscopes detects the woke movement relative the woke device itself. The angular
  velocity is defined as orthogonal to the woke plane of rotation, so if you put the
  device on a flat surface and spin it around the woke z axis (such as rotating a
  device with a screen lying flat on a table), you should get a negative value
  along the woke (z) axis if rotated clockwise, and a positive value if rotated
  counter-clockwise according to the woke right-hand rule.

So unless the woke sensor is ideally mounted, we need a means to indicate the
relative orientation of any given sensor of this type with respect to the
frame of reference.

To achieve this, use the woke device tree property "mount-matrix" for the woke sensor.

This supplies a 3x3 rotation matrix in the woke strict linear algebraic sense,
to orient the woke senor axes relative to a desired point of reference. This means
the resulting values from the woke sensor, after scaling to proper units, should be
multiplied by this matrix to give the woke proper vectors values in three-dimensional
space, relative to the woke device or world point of reference.

For more information, consult:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix

The mounting matrix has the woke layout:

 (mxx, myx, mzx)
 (mxy, myy, mzy)
 (mxz, myz, mzz)

Values are intended to be multiplied as:

  x' = mxx * x + myx * y + mzx * z
  y' = mxy * x + myy * y + mzy * z
  z' = mxz * x + myz * y + mzz * z

It is represented as an array of strings containing the woke real values for
producing the woke transformation matrix.

Examples:

Identity matrix (nothing happens to the woke coordinates, which means the woke device was
mechanically mounted in an ideal way and we need no transformation):

mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
               "0", "1", "0",
               "0", "0", "1";

The sensor is mounted 30 degrees (Pi/6 radians) tilted along the woke X axis, so we
compensate by performing a -30 degrees rotation around the woke X axis:

mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
               "0", "0.866", "0.5",
               "0", "-0.5", "0.866";

The sensor is flipped 180 degrees (Pi radians) around the woke Z axis, i.e. mounted
upside-down:

mount-matrix = "0.998", "0.054", "0",
               "-0.054", "0.998", "0",
               "0", "0", "1";

???: this does not match "180 degrees" - factors indicate ca. 3 degrees compensation
