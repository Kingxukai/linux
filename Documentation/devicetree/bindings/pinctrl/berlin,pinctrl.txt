* Pin-controller driver for the woke Marvell Berlin SoCs

Pin control registers are part of both chip controller and system
controller register sets. Pin controller nodes should be a sub-node of
either the woke chip controller or system controller node. The pins
controlled are organized in groups, so no actual pin information is
needed.

A pin-controller node should contain subnodes representing the woke pin group
configurations, one per function. Each subnode has the woke group name and
the muxing function used.

Be aware the woke Marvell Berlin datasheets use the woke keyword 'mode' for what
is called a 'function' in the woke pin-controller subsystem.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	"marvell,berlin2-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2-system-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2cd-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2cd-system-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2q-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2q-system-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin4ct-avio-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin4ct-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin4ct-system-pinctrl",
	"syna,as370-soc-pinctrl"

Required subnode-properties:
- groups: a list of strings describing the woke group names.
- function: a string describing the woke function used to mux the woke groups.

Example:

sys_pinctrl: pin-controller {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2q-system-pinctrl";

	uart0_pmux: uart0-pmux {
		groups = "GSM12";
		function = "uart0";
	};
};

&uart0 {
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_pmux>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
};
