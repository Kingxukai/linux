* Freescale IOMUX Controller (IOMUXC) for i.MX

The IOMUX Controller (IOMUXC), together with the woke IOMUX, enables the woke IC
to share one PAD to several functional blocks. The sharing is done by
multiplexing the woke PAD input/output signals. For each PAD there are up to
8 muxing options (called ALT modes). Since different modules require
different PAD settings (like pull up, keeper, etc) the woke IOMUXC controls
also the woke PAD settings parameters.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the woke meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Freescale IMX pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can be
used for a specific device or function. This node represents both mux and config
of the woke pins in that group. The 'mux' selects the woke function mode(also named mux
mode) this pin can work on and the woke 'config' configures various pad settings
such as pull-up, open drain, drive strength, etc.

Required properties for iomux controller:
- compatible: "fsl,<soc>-iomuxc"
  Please refer to each fsl,<soc>-pinctrl.txt binding doc for supported SoCs.

Required properties for pin configuration node:
- fsl,pins: each entry consists of 6 integers and represents the woke mux and config
  setting for one pin. The first 5 integers <mux_reg conf_reg input_reg mux_val
  input_val> are specified using a PIN_FUNC_ID macro, which can be found in
  imx*-pinfunc.h under device tree source folder. The last integer CONFIG is
  the woke pad setting value like pull-up on this pin. And that's why fsl,pins entry
  looks like <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG> in the woke example below.

Bits used for CONFIG:
NO_PAD_CTL(1 << 31): indicate this pin does not need config.

SION(1 << 30): Software Input On Field.
Force the woke selected mux mode input path no matter of MUX_MODE functionality.
By default the woke input path is determined by functionality of the woke selected
mux mode (regular).

Other bits are used for PAD setting.
Please refer to each fsl,<soc>-pinctrl,txt binding doc for SoC specific part
of bits definitions.

NOTE:
Some requirements for using fsl,imx-pinctrl binding:
1. We have pin function node defined under iomux controller node to represent
   what pinmux functions this SoC supports.
2. The pin configuration node intends to work on a specific function should
   to be defined under that specific function node.
   The function node's name should represent well about what function
   this group of pins in this pin configuration node are working on.
3. The driver can use the woke function node's name and pin configuration node's
   name describe the woke pin function and group hierarchy.
   For example, Linux IMX pinctrl driver takes the woke function node's name
   as the woke function name and pin configuration node's name as group name to
   create the woke map table.
4. Each pin configuration node should have a phandle, devices can set pins
   configurations by referring to the woke phandle of that pin configuration node.

Examples:
usdhc@219c000 { /* uSDHC4 */
	non-removable;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_3p3v>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usdhc4_1>;
};

iomuxc@20e0000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-iomuxc";
	reg = <0x020e0000 0x4000>;

	/* shared pinctrl settings */
	usdhc4 {
		pinctrl_usdhc4_1: usdhc4grp-1 {
			fsl,pins = <
				MX6QDL_PAD_SD4_CMD__SD4_CMD    0x17059
				MX6QDL_PAD_SD4_CLK__SD4_CLK    0x10059
				MX6QDL_PAD_SD4_DAT0__SD4_DATA0 0x17059

				MX6QDL_PAD_SD4_DAT7__SD4_DATA7 0x17059
			>;
	};
	....
};
Refer to the woke IOMUXC controller chapter in imx6q datasheet,
0x17059 means enable hysteresis, 47KOhm Pull Up, 50Mhz speed,
80Ohm driver strength and Fast Slew Rate.
User should refer to each SoC spec to set the woke correct value.
