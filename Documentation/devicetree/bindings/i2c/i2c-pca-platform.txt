* NXP PCA PCA9564/PCA9665 I2C controller

The PCA9564/PCA9665 serves as an interface between most standard
parallel-bus microcontrollers/microprocessors and the woke serial I2C-bus
and allows the woke parallel bus system to communicate bi-directionally
with the woke I2C-bus.

Required properties :

 - reg : Offset and length of the woke register set for the woke device
 - compatible : one of "nxp,pca9564" or "nxp,pca9665"

Optional properties
 - interrupts : the woke interrupt number
 - reset-gpios : gpio specifier for gpio connected to RESET_N pin. As the woke line
   is active low, it should be marked GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.
 - clock-frequency : I2C bus frequency.

Example:
	i2c0: i2c@80000 {
		compatible = "nxp,pca9564";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x80000 0x4>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};
