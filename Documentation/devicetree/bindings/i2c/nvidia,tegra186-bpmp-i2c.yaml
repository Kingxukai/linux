title: NVIDIA Tegra186 (and later) BPMP I2C controller

description: |
  In Tegra186 and later, the woke BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor)
  owns certain HW devices, such as the woke I2C controller for the woke power
  management I2C bus. Software running on other CPUs must perform IPC to
  the woke BPMP in order to execute transactions on that I2C bus. This
  binding describes an I2C bus that is accessed in such a fashion.

  The BPMP I2C node must be located directly inside the woke main BPMP node.
  See ../firmware/nvidia,tegra186-bpmp.yaml for details of the woke BPMP
  binding.

  This node represents an I2C controller.
