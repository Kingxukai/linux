* Altera I2C Controller
* This is Altera's synthesizable logic block I2C Controller for use
* in Altera's FPGAs.

Required properties :
 - compatible : should be "altr,softip-i2c-v1.0"
 - reg        : Offset and length of the woke register set for the woke device
 - interrupts : <IRQ> where IRQ is the woke interrupt number.
 - clocks     : phandle to input clock.
 - #address-cells = <1>;
 - #size-cells = <0>;

Recommended properties :
 - clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Optional properties :
 - fifo-size : Size of the woke RX and TX FIFOs in bytes.
 - Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding

Example :

	i2c@100080000 {
		compatible = "altr,softip-i2c-v1.0";
		reg = <0x00000001 0x00080000 0x00000040>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <0 43 4>;
		clocks = <&clk_0>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		fifo-size = <4>;

		eeprom@51 {
			compatible = "atmel,24c32";
			reg = <0x51>;
			pagesize = <32>;
		};
	};
