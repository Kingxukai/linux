* Xillybus driver for generic FPGA interface

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xillybus,xillybus-1.00.a"
- reg: Address and length of the woke register set for the woke device
- interrupts: Contains one interrupt node, typically consisting of three cells.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if DMA operations are coherent

Example:

	xillybus@ff200400 {
		compatible = "xillybus,xillybus-1.00.a";
		reg = < 0xff200400 0x00000080 >;
		interrupts = < 0 40 1 >;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	} ;
