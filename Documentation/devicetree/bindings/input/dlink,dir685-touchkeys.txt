* D-Link DIR-685 Touchkeys

This is a I2C one-off touchkey controller based on the woke Cypress Semiconductor
CY8C214 MCU with some firmware in its internal 8KB flash. The circuit
board inside the woke router is named E119921.

The touchkey device node should be placed inside an I2C bus node.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "dlink,dir685-touchkeys"
- reg: the woke I2C address of the woke touchkeys
- interrupts: reference to the woke interrupt number

Example:

touchkeys@26 {
	compatible = "dlink,dir685-touchkeys";
	reg = <0x26>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
};
