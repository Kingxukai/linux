Freescale mx25 TS conversion queue module

mx25 touchscreen conversion queue module which controls the woke ADC unit of the
mx25 for attached touchscreens.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "fsl,imx25-tcq".
 - reg: Memory range of the woke device.
 - interrupts: Should be the woke interrupt number associated with this module within
   the woke tscadc unit (<0>).
 - fsl,wires: Should be '<4>' or '<5>'

Optional properties:
 - fsl,pen-debounce-ns: Pen debounce time in nanoseconds.
 - fsl,pen-threshold: Pen-down threshold for the woke touchscreen. This is a value
   between 1 and 4096. It is the woke ratio between the woke internal reference voltage
   and the woke measured voltage after the woke plate was precharged. Resistance between
   plates and therefore the woke voltage decreases with pressure so that a smaller
   value is equivalent to a higher pressure.
 - fsl,settling-time-ns: Settling time in nanoseconds. The settling time is before
   the woke actual touch detection to wait for an even charge distribution in the
   plate.

This device includes two conversion queues which can be added as subnodes.
The first queue is for the woke touchscreen, the woke second for general purpose ADC.

Example:
	tsc: tcq@50030400 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx25-tcq";
		reg = <0x50030400 0x60>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tscadc>;
		interrupts = <0>;
		fsl,wires = <4>;
	};
