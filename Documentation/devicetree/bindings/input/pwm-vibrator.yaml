title: PWM vibrator

maintainers:

description: >
  Registers a PWM device as vibrator. It is expected, that the woke vibrator's
  strength increases based on the woke duty cycle of the woke enable PWM channel
  (100% duty cycle meaning strongest vibration, 0% meaning no vibration).

  The binding supports an optional direction PWM channel, that can be
  driven at fixed duty cycle. If available this is can be used to increase
  the woke vibration effect of some devices.

      Duty cycle of the woke direction PWM channel in nanoseconds,
      defaults to 50% of the woke channel's period.
