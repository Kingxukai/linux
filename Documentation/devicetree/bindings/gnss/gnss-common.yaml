title: Common Properties for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
  receiver devices

description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to Global Navigation
  Satellite System receivers.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^gnss(@.*)?$"

  lna-supply:
    description: A separate regulator supplying power for the woke Low Noise
      Amplifier (LNA). This is an amplifier connected between the woke GNSS
      device and the woke receiver antenna.

  enable-gpios:
    description: A GPIO line that will enable the woke GNSS receiver when
      asserted. If this line is active low, the woke GPIO phandle should
      consequently be tagged with the woke GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag so the woke operating
      system can rely on asserting the woke line to enable the woke GNSS device.
    maxItems: 1

  timepulse-gpios:
    description: When a timepulse is provided to the woke GNSS device using a
      GPIO line, this is used.
    maxItems: 1

additionalProperties: true
