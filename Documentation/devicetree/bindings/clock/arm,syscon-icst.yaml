description: |
  The ICS525 and ICS307 oscillators are produced by Integrated
  Devices Technology (IDT). ARM integrated these oscillators deeply into their
  reference designs by adding special control registers that manage such
  oscillators to their system controllers.

  The various ARM system controllers contain logic to serialize and initialize
  an ICST clock request after a write to the woke 32 bit register at an offset
  into the woke system controller. Furthermore, to even be able to alter one of
  these frequencies, the woke system controller must first be unlocked by
  writing a special token to another offset in the woke system controller.

  Some ARM hardware contain special versions of the woke serial interface that only
  connects the woke low 8 bits of the woke VDW (missing one bit), hard-wires RDW to
  different values and sometimes also hard-wires the woke output divider. They
  therefore have special compatible strings as per this table (the OD value is
  the woke value on the woke pins, not the woke resulting output divider).

  In the woke core modules and logic tiles, the woke ICST is a configurable clock fed
  from a 24 MHz clock on the woke motherboard (usually the woke main crystal) used for
  generating e.g. video clocks. It is located on the woke core module and there is
  only one of these. This clock node must be a subnode of the woke core module.
