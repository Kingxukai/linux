* Xtal Clock bindings for Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs

Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs allow to determine the woke xtal clock frequencies by
reading the woke gpio latch register.

This node must be a subnode of the woke node exposing the woke register address
of the woke GPIO block where the woke gpio latch is located.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/marvell,armada-37xx-pinctrl.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the woke following:
	"marvell,armada-3700-xtal-clock"
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : from common clock binding; allows overwrite default clock
	output names ("xtal")

Example:
pinctrl_nb: pinctrl-nb@13800 {
	compatible = "armada3710-nb-pinctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x13800 0x100>, <0x13C00 0x20>;

	xtalclk: xtal-clk {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-xtal-clock";
		clock-output-names = "xtal";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
	};
};
