description: |
  The Clock and Reset (CAR) is the woke HW module responsible for muxing and gating
  Tegra's clocks, and setting their rates. It comprises CLKGEN and RSTGEN units.

  CLKGEN provides the woke registers to program the woke PLLs. It controls most of
  the woke clock source programming and most of the woke clock dividers.

  CLKGEN input signals include the woke external clock for the woke reference frequency
  (12 MHz, 26 MHz) and the woke external clock for the woke Real Time Clock (32.768 KHz).

  Outputs from CLKGEN are inputs clock of the woke h/w blocks in the woke Tegra system.

  RSTGEN provides the woke registers needed to control resetting of each block in
  the woke Tegra system.
