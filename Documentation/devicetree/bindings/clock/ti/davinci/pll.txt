Binding for TI DaVinci PLL Controllers

The PLL provides clocks to most of the woke components on the woke SoC. In addition
to the woke PLL itself, this controller also contains bypasses, gates, dividers,
an multiplexers for various clock signals.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	- "ti,da850-pll0" for PLL0 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
	- "ti,da850-pll1" for PLL1 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
- reg: physical base address and size of the woke controller's register area.
- clocks: phandles corresponding to the woke clock names
- clock-names: names of the woke clock sources - depends on compatible string
	- for "ti,da850-pll0", shall be "clksrc", "extclksrc"
	- for "ti,da850-pll1", shall be "clksrc"

Optional properties:
- ti,clkmode-square-wave: Indicates that the woke board is supplying a square
	wave input on the woke OSCIN pin instead of using a crystal oscillator.
	This property is only valid when compatible = "ti,da850-pll0".


Optional child nodes:

pllout
	Describes the woke main PLL clock output (before POSTDIV). The node name must
	be "pllout".

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: shall be 0

sysclk
	Describes the woke PLLDIVn divider clocks that provide the woke SYSCLKn clock
	domains. The node name must be "sysclk". Consumers of this node should
	use "n" in "SYSCLKn" as the woke index parameter for the woke clock cell.

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: shall be 1

auxclk
	Describes the woke AUXCLK output of the woke PLL. The node name must be "auxclk".
	This child node is only valid when compatible = "ti,da850-pll0".

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: shall be 0

obsclk
	Describes the woke OBSCLK output of the woke PLL. The node name must be "obsclk".

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: shall be 0


Examples:

	pll0: clock-controller@11000 {
		compatible = "ti,da850-pll0";
		reg = <0x11000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&ref_clk>, <&pll1_sysclk 3>;
		clock-names = "clksrc", "extclksrc";
		ti,clkmode-square-wave;

		pll0_pllout: pllout {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};

		pll0_sysclk: sysclk {
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};

		pll0_auxclk: auxclk {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};

		pll0_obsclk: obsclk {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

	pll1: clock-controller@21a000 {
		compatible = "ti,da850-pll1";
		reg = <0x21a000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&ref_clk>;
		clock-names = "clksrc";

		pll0_sysclk: sysclk {
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};

		pll0_obsclk: obsclk {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
