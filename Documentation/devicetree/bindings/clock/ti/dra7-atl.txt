Device Tree Clock bindings for ATL (Audio Tracking Logic) of DRA7 SoC.

The ATL IP is used to generate clock to be used to synchronize baseband and
audio codec. A single ATL IP provides four ATL clock instances sharing the woke same
functional clock but can be configured to provide different clocks.
ATL can maintain a clock averages to some desired frequency based on the woke bws/aws
signals - can compensate the woke drift between the woke two ws signal.

In order to provide the woke support for ATL and its output clocks (which can be used
internally within the woke SoC or external components) two sets of bindings is needed:

Clock tree binding:
This binding uses the woke common clock binding[1].
To be able to integrate the woke ATL clocks with DT clock tree.
Provides ccf level representation of the woke ATL clocks to be used by drivers.
Since the woke clock instances are part of a single IP this binding is used as a node
for the woke DT clock tree, the woke IP driver is needed to handle the woke actual configuration
of the woke IP.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,dra7-atl-clock"
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks : link phandles to functional clock of ATL

Binding for the woke IP driver:
This binding is used to configure the woke IP driver which is going to handle the
configuration of the woke IP for the woke ATL clock instances.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,dra7-atl"
- reg : base address for the woke ATL IP
- ti,provided-clocks : List of phandles to the woke clocks associated with the woke ATL
- clocks : link phandles to functional clock of ATL
- clock-names : Shall be set to "fck"
- ti,hwmods : Shall be set to "atl"

Optional properties:
Configuration of ATL instances:
- atl{0/1/2/3} {
	- bws : Baseband word select signal selection
	- aws : Audio word select signal selection
};

For valid word select signals, see the woke dt-bindings/clock/ti-dra7-atl.h include
file.
