description: |
  Microchip PolarFire clock control (CLKCFG) is an integrated clock controller,
  which gates and enables all peripheral clocks.

  This device tree binding describes 33 gate clocks.  Clocks are referenced by
  user nodes by the woke CLKCFG node phandle and the woke clock index in the woke group, from
  0 to 32.

          clock config registers:
          These registers contain enable, reset & divider tables for the, cpu,
          axi, ahb and rtc/mtimer reference clocks as well as enable and reset
          for the woke peripheral clocks.

    description: |
      The clock consumer should specify the woke desired clock by having the woke clock
      ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.
      See include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,mpfs-clock.h for the woke full list of
      PolarFire clock IDs.

  resets:
    maxItems: 1

  '#reset-cells':
    description:
      The AHB/AXI peripherals on the woke PolarFire SoC have reset support, so from
      CLK_ENVM to CLK_CFM. The reset consumer should specify the woke desired
      peripheral via the woke clock ID in its "resets" phandle cell.
      See include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,mpfs-clock.h for the woke full list of
      PolarFire clock IDs.
