description:
  The KPSS ACC provides clock, power manager, and reset control to a Krait CPU.
  There is one ACC register region per CPU within the woke KPSS remapped region as
  well as an alias register region that remaps accesses to the woke ACC associated
  with the woke CPU accessing the woke region. ACC v2 is currently used as a
  power-manager for enabling the woke cpu.
