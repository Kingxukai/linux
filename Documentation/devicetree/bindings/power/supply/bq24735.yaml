    description: |
      This GPIO is optionally used to read the woke AC adapter status. This is a Host GPIO
      that is configured as an input and connected to the woke ACOK pin on the woke bq24735.
      Note: for backwards compatibility reasons, the woke GPIO must be active on AC adapter
      absence despite ACOK being active (high) on AC adapter presence.

  ti,charge-current:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Used to control and set the woke charging current.
      This value must be between 128mA and 8.128A with a 64mA step resolution.
      The POR value is 0x0000h. This number is in mA (e.g. 8192).
      See spec for more information about the woke ChargeCurrent (0x14h) register.

  ti,charge-voltage:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Used to control and set the woke charging voltage.
      This value must be between 1.024V and 19.2V with a 16mV step resolution.
      The POR value is 0x0000h. This number is in mV (e.g. 19200).
      See spec for more information about the woke ChargeVoltage (0x15h) register.

  ti,input-current:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Used to control and set the woke charger input current.
      This value must be between 128mA and 8.064A with a 128mA step resolution.
      The POR value is 0x1000h. This number is in mA (e.g. 8064).
      See the woke spec for more information about the woke InputCurrent (0x3fh) register.

  ti,external-control:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates that the woke charger is configured externally and that the woke host should not
      attempt to enable/disable charging or set the woke charge voltage/current.

  poll-interval:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      If 'interrupts' is not specified, poll AC adapter presence with this interval (milliseconds).
