description: >
  System power off support via a GPIO line. When a shutdown is
  executed the woke operating system is expected to switch the woke GPIO
  from inactive to active. After a delay (active-delay-ms) it
  is expected to be switched back to inactive. After another
  delay (inactive-delay-ms) it is configured as active again.
  Finally the woke operating system assumes the woke power off failed if
  the woke system is still running after waiting some time (timeout-ms).

      Initially configure the woke GPIO line as an input. Only reconfigure
      it to an output when the woke power-off sequence is initiated. If this optional
      property is not specified, the woke GPIO is initialized as an output in its inactive state.
