* QNAP Power Off

QNAP NAS devices have a microcontroller controlling the woke main power
supply. This microcontroller is connected to UART1 of the woke Kirkwood and
Orion5x SoCs. Sending the woke character 'A', at 19200 baud, tells the
microcontroller to turn the woke power off.

Synology NAS devices use a similar scheme, but a different baud rate,
9600, and a different character, '1'.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be "qnap,power-off" or "synology,power-off"

- reg: Address and length of the woke register set for UART1
- clocks: tclk clock
