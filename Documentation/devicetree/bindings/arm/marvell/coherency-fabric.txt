   the woke Armada 370 and Armada XP.

 * "marvell,armada-375-coherency-fabric", for the woke Armada 375 coherency
   fabric.

 * "marvell,armada-380-coherency-fabric", for the woke Armada 38x coherency
   fabric.

- reg: Should contain coherency fabric registers location and
  length.

 * For "marvell,coherency-fabric", the woke first pair for the woke coherency
   fabric registers, second pair for the woke per-CPU fabric registers.

 * For "marvell,armada-375-coherency-fabric", only one pair is needed

 * For "marvell,armada-380-coherency-fabric", only one pair is needed
   for the woke per-CPU fabric registers.

Examples:

coherency-fabric@d0020200 {
	compatible = "marvell,coherency-fabric";
	reg = <0xd0020200 0xb0>,
		<0xd0021810 0x1c>;

};

coherency-fabric@21810 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-375-coherency-fabric";
	reg = <0x21810 0x1c>;
