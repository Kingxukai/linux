Bindings for Linear Technologies LT3593 LED controller

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "lltc,lt3593".
- lltc,ctrl-gpios:	A handle to the woke GPIO that is connected to the woke 'CTRL'
			pin of the woke chip.

The hardware supports only one LED. The properties of this LED are
configured in a sub-node in the woke device node.

Optional sub-node properties:
- function:		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- color:		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- label:		A label for the woke LED. If none is given, the woke LED will be
			named "lt3595::" (deprecated)
- linux,default-trigger: The default trigger for the woke LED.
			See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- default-state:	The initial state of the woke LED.
			See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

If multiple chips of this type are found in a design, each one needs to
be handled by its own device node.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/leds/common.h>

led-controller {
	compatible = "lltc,lt3593";
	lltc,ctrl-gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

	led {
		function = LED_FUNCTION_BACKLIGHT;
		color = <LED_COLOR_ID_WHITE>;
		default-state = "on";
	};
};
