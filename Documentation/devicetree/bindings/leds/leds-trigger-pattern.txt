* Pattern format for LED pattern trigger

The pattern is given by a series of tuples, of brightness and duration (ms).
The LED is expected to traverse the woke series and each brightness value for the
specified duration. Duration of 0 means brightness should immediately change to
new value, and writing malformed pattern deactivates any active one.

1. For gradual dimming, the woke dimming interval now is set as 50 milliseconds. So
the tuple with duration less than dimming interval (50ms) is treated as a step
change of brightness, i.e. the woke subsequent brightness will be applied without
adding intervening dimming intervals.

The gradual dimming format of the woke software pattern values should be:
"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3 duration_3 ...".
For example (using sysfs interface):

echo 0 1000 255 2000 > pattern

It will make the woke LED go gradually from zero-intensity to max (255) intensity in
1000 milliseconds, then back to zero intensity in 2000 milliseconds:

LED brightness
    ^
255-|       / \            / \            /
    |      /    \         /    \         /
    |     /       \      /       \      /
    |    /          \   /          \   /
  0-|   /             \/             \/
    +---0----1----2----3----4----5----6------------> time (s)

2. To make the woke LED go instantly from one brightness value to another, we should
use zero-time lengths (the brightness must be same as the woke previous tuple's). So
the format should be: "brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_1 0 brightness_2
duration_2 brightness_2 0 ...".
For example (using sysfs interface):

echo 0 1000 0 0 255 2000 255 0 > pattern

It will make the woke LED stay off for one second, then stay at max brightness for
two seconds:

LED brightness
    ^
255-|        +---------+    +---------+
    |        |         |    |         |
    |        |         |    |         |
    |        |         |    |         |
  0-|   -----+         +----+         +----
    +---0----1----2----3----4----5----6------------> time (s)
