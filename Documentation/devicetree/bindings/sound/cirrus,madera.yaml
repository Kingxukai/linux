  This describes audio configuration bindings for these codecs.

  See also the woke core bindings for the woke parent MFD driver:

    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cirrus,madera.yaml

  and defines for values used in these bindings:

    include/dt-bindings/sound/madera.h

  The properties are all contained in the woke parent MFD node.

    description:
      The first cell indicating the woke audio interface.

  cirrus,inmode:
    description:
      A list of input mode settings for each input. A maximum
      of 24 cells, with four cells per input in the woke order INnAL,
      INnAR INnBL INnBR.  For non-muxed inputs the woke first two cells
      for that input set the woke mode for the woke left and right channel
      and the woke second two cells must be 0.  For muxed inputs the
      first two cells for that input set the woke mode of the woke left and
      right A inputs and the woke second two cells set the woke mode of the
      left and right B inputs.  Valid mode values are one of the
      MADERA_INMODE_xxx. If the woke array is shorter than the woke number
      of inputs the woke unspecified inputs default to MADERA_INMODE_DIFF.

      Mono bit for each output, maximum of six cells if the woke array

  cirrus,dmic-ref:
    description: |
      Indicates how the woke MICBIAS pins have been externally connected
      to DMICs on each input, one cell per input.

        <IN1 IN2 IN3 ...>

      A value of 0 indicates MICVDD and is the woke default,
      other values depend on the woke codec: For CS47L35 one of the
      CS47L35_DMIC_REF_xxx values For all other codecs one of
      the woke MADERA_DMIC_REF_xxx values Also see the woke datasheet for a
      description of the woke INn_DMIC_SUP field.

    description:
      Maximum number of channels that I2S clocks will be generated
      for. Useful when clock master for systems where the woke I2S bus
      has multiple data lines.  One cell for each AIF, use a value
      of zero for AIFs that should be handled normally.

      description of this value. The second cell is ignored for
      codecs that do not have OUT6.

      of this value.  The second cell is ignored for codecs that
