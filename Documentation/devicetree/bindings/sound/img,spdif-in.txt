Required Properties:

  - compatible : Compatible list, must contain "img,spdif-in"

  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

  - reg : Offset and length of the woke register set for the woke device

  - dmas: Contains an entry for each entry in dma-names.

  - dma-names: Must include the woke following entry:
	"rx"

  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names

  - clock-names : Includes the woke following entries:
	"sys"	The system clock

Optional Properties:

  - resets: Should contain a phandle to the woke spdif in reset signal, if any

  - reset-names: Should contain the woke reset signal name "rst", if a
	reset phandle is given

  - interrupts : Contains the woke spdif in interrupt, if present

Example:

spdif_in: spdif-in@18100e00 {
	compatible = "img,spdif-in";
	reg = <0x18100E00 0x100>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	dmas = <&mdc 15 0xffffffff 0>;
	dma-names = "rx";
	clocks = <&cr_periph SYS_CLK_SPDIF_IN>;
	clock-names = "sys";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
};
