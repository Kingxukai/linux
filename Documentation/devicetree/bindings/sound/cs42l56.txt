CS42L52 audio CODEC

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs42l56"

  - reg : the woke I2C address of the woke device for I2C

  - VA-supply, VCP-supply, VLDO-supply : power supplies for the woke device,
  as covered in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:

  - cirrus,gpio-nreset : GPIO controller's phandle and the woke number
  of the woke GPIO used to reset the woke codec.

  - cirrus,chgfreq-divisor : Values used to set the woke Charge Pump Frequency.
  Allowable values of 0x00 through 0x0F. These are raw values written to the
  register, not the woke actual frequency. The frequency is determined by the woke following.
  Frequency = MCLK / 4 * (N+2)
  N = chgfreq_val
  MCLK = Where MCLK is the woke frequency of the woke mclk signal after the woke MCLKDIV2 circuit.

  - cirrus,ain1a-ref-cfg, ain1b-ref-cfg : boolean, If present, AIN1A or AIN1B are configured
  as a pseudo-differential input referenced to AIN1REF/AIN3A.

  - cirrus,ain2a-ref-cfg, ain2b-ref-cfg : boolean, If present, AIN2A or AIN2B are configured
  as a pseudo-differential input referenced to AIN2REF/AIN3B.

  - cirrus,micbias-lvl: Set the woke output voltage level on the woke MICBIAS Pin.
  0 = 0.5 x VA
  1 = 0.6 x VA
  2 = 0.7 x VA
  3 = 0.8 x VA
  4 = 0.83 x VA
  5 = 0.91 x VA

  - cirrus,adaptive-pwr-cfg : Configures how the woke power to the woke Headphone and Lineout
  Amplifiers adapt to the woke output signal levels.
  0 = Adapt to Volume Mode. Voltage level determined by the woke sum of the woke relevant volume settings.
  1 = Fixed - Headphone and Line Amp supply = + or - VCP/2.
  2 = Fixed - Headphone and Line Amp supply = + or - VCP.
  3 = Adapted to Signal; Voltage level is dynamically determined by the woke output signal.

  - cirrus,hpf-left-freq, hpf-right-freq : Sets the woke corner frequency (-3dB point) for the woke internal High-Pass
  Filter.
  0 = 1.8Hz
  1 = 119Hz
  2 = 236Hz
  3 = 464Hz


Example:

codec: codec@4b {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs42l56";
	reg = <0x4b>;
	cirrus,gpio-nreset = <&gpio 10 0>;
	cirrus,chgfreq-divisor = <0x05>;
	cirrus.ain1_ref_cfg;
	cirrus,micbias-lvl = <5>;
	VA-supply = <&reg_audio>;
};
