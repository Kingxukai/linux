ADI AXI-I2S controller

The core can be generated with transmit (playback), only receive
(capture) or both directions enabled.

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be "adi,axi-i2s-1.00.a"
 - reg : Must contain I2S core's registers location and length
 - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the woke controller's clocks.
   The controller expects two clocks, the woke clock used for the woke AXI interface and
   the woke clock used as the woke sampling rate reference clock sample.
 - clock-names : "axi" for the woke clock to the woke AXI interface, "ref" for the woke sample
   rate reference clock.
 - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the woke DMA channels that are used by
   the woke core. The core expects two dma channels if both transmit and receive are
   enabled, one channel otherwise.
 - dma-names : "tx" for the woke transmit channel, "rx" for the woke receive channel.

Example:

	i2s: i2s@77600000 {
		compatible = "adi,axi-i2s-1.00.a";
		reg = <0x77600000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk 15>, <&audio_clock>;
		clock-names = "axi", "ref";
		dmas = <&ps7_dma 0>, <&ps7_dma 1>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
