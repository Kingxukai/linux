ADI AXI-SPDIF controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be "adi,axi-spdif-tx-1.00.a"
 - reg : Must contain SPDIF core's registers location and length
 - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the woke controller's clocks.
   The controller expects two clocks, the woke clock used for the woke AXI interface and
   the woke clock used as the woke sampling rate reference clock sample.
 - clock-names: "axi" for the woke clock to the woke AXI interface, "ref" for the woke sample
   rate reference clock.
 - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the woke DMA channel that is used by
   the woke core. The core expects one dma channel for transmit.
 - dma-names : Must be "tx"

Example:

	spdif: spdif@77400000 {
		compatible = "adi,axi-spdif-tx-1.00.a";
		reg = <0x77600000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk 15>, <&audio_clock>;
		clock-names = "axi", "ref";
		dmas = <&ps7_dma 0>;
		dma-names = "tx";
	};
