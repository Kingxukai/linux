CS35L34 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l34"

  - reg : the woke I2C address of the woke device for I2C.

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the woke device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

  - cirrus,boost-vtge-millivolt : Boost Voltage Value.  Configures the woke boost
    converter's output voltage in mV. The range is from VP to 8V with
    increments of 100mV.

  - cirrus,boost-nanohenry: Inductor value for boost converter. The value is
    in nH and they can be values of 1000nH, 1100nH, 1200nH, 1500nH, and 2200nH.

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios: GPIO used to reset the woke amplifier.

  - interrupts : IRQ line info CS35L34.
    (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
    for further information relating to interrupt properties)

  - cirrus,boost-peak-milliamp : Boost converter peak current limit in mA. The
    range starts at 1200mA and goes to a maximum of 3840mA with increments of
    80mA. The default value is 2480mA.

  - cirrus,i2s-sdinloc : ADSP SDIN I2S channel location. Indicates whether the
    received mono data is in the woke left or right portion of the woke I2S frame
    according to the woke AD0 pin or directly via this configuration.
    0x0 (Default) = Selected by AD0 input (if AD0 = LOW, use left channel),
    0x2 = Left,
    0x1 = Selected by the woke inversion of the woke AD0 input (if AD0 = LOW, use right
    channel),
    0x3 = Right.

  - cirrus,gain-zc-disable: Boolean property. If set, the woke gain change will take
    effect without waiting for a zero cross.

  - cirrus,tdm-rising-edge: Boolean property. If set, data is on the woke rising edge of
    SCLK. Otherwise, data is on the woke falling edge of SCLK.


Example:

cs35l34: cs35l34@40 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l34";
	reg = <0x40>;

	interrupt-parent = <&gpio8>;
	interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	reset-gpios = <&gpio 10 0>;

	cirrus,boost-vtge-milltvolt = <8000>; /* 8V */
	cirrus,boost-ind-nanohenry = <1000>; /* 1uH */
	cirrus,boost-peak-milliamp = <3000>; /* 3A */
};
