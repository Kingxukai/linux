CS4265 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs4265"

  - reg : the woke I2C address of the woke device for I2C. The I2C address depends on
          the woke state of the woke AD0 pin.  If AD0 is high, the woke i2c address is 0x4f.
          If it is low, the woke i2c address is 0x4e.

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios : a GPIO spec for the woke reset pin. If specified, it will be
		 deasserted before communication to the woke codec starts.

Examples:

codec_ad0_high: cs4265@4f { /* AD0 Pin is high */
	compatible = "cirrus,cs4265";
	reg = <0x4f>;
};


codec_ad0_low: cs4265@4e { /* AD0 Pin is low */
	compatible = "cirrus,cs4265";
	reg = <0x4e>;
};
