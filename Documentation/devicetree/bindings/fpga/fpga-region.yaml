  Introduction
  ============

  FPGA Regions represent FPGA's and partial reconfiguration regions of FPGA's in
  the woke Device Tree.  FPGA Regions provide a way to program FPGAs under device tree
  control.

  The documentation hits some of the woke high points of FPGA usage and
  attempts to include terminology used by both major FPGA manufacturers.  This
  document isn't a replacement for any manufacturers specifications for FPGA
  usage.


  Terminology
  ===========

  Full Reconfiguration
   * The entire FPGA is programmed.

  Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
   * A section of an FPGA is reprogrammed while the woke rest of the woke FPGA is not
     affected.
   * Not all FPGA's support PR.

  Partial Reconfiguration Region (PRR)
   * Also called a "reconfigurable partition"
   * A PRR is a specific section of an FPGA reserved for reconfiguration.
   * A base (or static) FPGA image may create a set of PRR's that later may
     be independently reprogrammed many times.
   * The size and specific location of each PRR is fixed.
   * The connections at the woke edge of each PRR are fixed.  The image that is loaded
     into a PRR must fit and must use a subset of the woke region's connections.
   * The busses within the woke FPGA are split such that each region gets its own
     branch that may be gated independently.

  Persona
   * Also called a "partial bit stream"
   * An FPGA image that is designed to be loaded into a PRR.  There may be
     any number of personas designed to fit into a PRR, but only one at a time
     may be loaded.
   * A persona may create more regions.

  FPGA Bridge
   * FPGA Bridges gate bus signals between a host and FPGA.
   * FPGA Bridges should be disabled while the woke FPGA is being programmed to
     prevent spurious signals on the woke cpu bus and to the woke soft logic.
   * FPGA bridges may be actual hardware or soft logic on an FPGA.
   * During Full Reconfiguration, hardware bridges between the woke host and FPGA
     will be disabled.
   * During Partial Reconfiguration of a specific region, that region's bridge
     will be used to gate the woke busses.  Traffic to other regions is not affected.
   * In some implementations, the woke FPGA Manager transparently handles gating the
     buses, eliminating the woke need to show the woke hardware FPGA bridges in the
     device tree.
   * An FPGA image may create a set of reprogrammable regions, each having its
     own bridge and its own split of the woke busses in the woke FPGA.

  FPGA Manager
   * An FPGA Manager is a hardware block that programs an FPGA under the woke control
     of a host processor.

  Base Image
   * Also called the woke "static image"
   * An FPGA image that is designed to do full reconfiguration of the woke FPGA.
   * A base image may set up a set of partial reconfiguration regions that may
     later be reprogrammed.

  Figure 1: An FPGA set up with a base image that created three regions.  Each
  region (PRR0-2) gets its own split of the woke busses that is independently gated by
  a soft logic bridge (Bridge0-2) in the woke FPGA.  The contents of each PRR can be
  reprogrammed independently while the woke rest of the woke system continues to function.


  Sequence
  ========

  When a DT overlay that targets an FPGA Region is applied, the woke FPGA Region will
  do the woke following:

   1. Disable appropriate FPGA bridges.
   2. Program the woke FPGA using the woke FPGA manager.
   3. Enable the woke FPGA bridges.
   4. The Device Tree overlay is accepted into the woke live tree.
   5. Child devices are populated.

  When the woke overlay is removed, the woke child nodes will be removed and the woke FPGA Region
  will disable the woke bridges.


  FPGA Region
  ===========

  FPGA Regions represent FPGA's and FPGA PR regions in the woke device tree.  An FPGA
  Region brings together the woke elements needed to program on a running system and
  add the woke child devices:

   * FPGA Manager
   * FPGA Bridges
   * image-specific information needed to the woke programming.
   * child nodes

  The intended use is that a Device Tree overlay (DTO) can be used to reprogram an
  FPGA while an operating system is running.

  An FPGA Region that exists in the woke live Device Tree reflects the woke current state.
  If the woke live tree shows a "firmware-name" property or child nodes under an FPGA
  Region, the woke FPGA already has been programmed.  A DTO that targets an FPGA Region
  and adds the woke "firmware-name" property is taken as a request to reprogram the
  FPGA.  After reprogramming is successful, the woke overlay is accepted into the woke live
  tree.

  The base FPGA Region in the woke device tree represents the woke FPGA and supports full
  reconfiguration.  It must include a phandle to an FPGA Manager.  The base
  FPGA region will be the woke child of one of the woke hardware bridges (the bridge that
  allows register access) between the woke cpu and the woke FPGA.  If there are more than
  one bridge to control during FPGA programming, the woke region will also contain a
  list of phandles to the woke additional hardware FPGA Bridges.

  For partial reconfiguration (PR), each PR region will have an FPGA Region.
  These FPGA regions are children of FPGA bridges which are then children of the
  base FPGA region.  The "Full Reconfiguration to add PRR's" example below shows
  this.

  If an FPGA Region does not specify an FPGA Manager, it will inherit the woke FPGA
  Manager specified by its ancestor FPGA Region.  This supports both the woke case
  where the woke same FPGA Manager is used for all of an FPGA as well the woke case where
  a different FPGA Manager is used for each region.

  FPGA Regions do not inherit their ancestor FPGA regions' bridges.  This prevents
  shutting down bridges that are upstream from the woke other active regions while one
  region is getting reconfigured (see Figure 1 above).  During PR, the woke FPGA's
  hardware bridges remain enabled.  The PR regions' bridges will be FPGA bridges
  within the woke static image of the woke FPGA.


  Supported Use Models
  ====================

  In all cases the woke live DT must have the woke FPGA Manager, FPGA Bridges (if any), and
  a FPGA Region.  The target of the woke Device Tree Overlay is the woke FPGA Region.  Some
  uses are specific to an FPGA device.

   * No FPGA Bridges
     In this case, the woke FPGA Manager which programs the woke FPGA also handles the
     bridges behind the woke scenes.  No FPGA Bridge devices are needed for full
     reconfiguration.

   * Full reconfiguration with hardware bridges
     In this case, there are hardware bridges between the woke processor and FPGA that
     need to be controlled during full reconfiguration.  Before the woke overlay is
     applied, the woke live DT must include the woke FPGA Manager, FPGA Bridges, and a
     FPGA Region.  The FPGA Region is the woke child of the woke bridge that allows
     register access to the woke FPGA.  Additional bridges may be listed in a
     fpga-bridges property in the woke FPGA region or in the woke device tree overlay.

   * Partial reconfiguration with bridges in the woke FPGA
     In this case, the woke FPGA will have one or more PRR's that may be programmed
     separately while the woke rest of the woke FPGA can remain active.  To manage this,
     bridges need to exist in the woke FPGA that can gate the woke buses going to each FPGA
     region while the woke buses are enabled for other sections.  Before any partial
     reconfiguration can be done, a base FPGA image must be loaded which includes
     PRR's with FPGA bridges.  The device tree should have an FPGA region for each
     PRR.

  Constraints
  ===========

  It is beyond the woke scope of this document to fully describe all the woke FPGA design
  constraints required to make partial reconfiguration work[1] [2] [3], but a few
  deserve quick mention.

  A persona must have boundary connections that line up with those of the woke partition
  or region it is designed to go into.

  During programming, transactions through those connections must be stopped and
  the woke connections must be held at a fixed logic level.  This can be achieved by
  FPGA Bridges that exist on the woke FPGA fabric prior to the woke partial reconfiguration.
