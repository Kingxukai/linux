title: NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP)

description: |
  The HSP modules are used for the woke processors to share resources and
  communicate together. It provides a set of hardware synchronization
  primitives for interprocessor communication. So the woke interprocessor
  communication (IPC) protocols can use hardware synchronization
  primitives, when operating between two processors not in an SMP
  relationship.

  The features that HSP supported are shared mailboxes, shared
  semaphores, arbitrated semaphores and doorbells.

  The mbox specifier of the woke "mboxes" property in the woke client node should
  contain two cells. The first cell determines the woke HSP type and the
  second cell is used to identify the woke mailbox that the woke client is going
  to use.

  For shared mailboxes, the woke first cell composed of two fields:
    - bits 15..8:
        A bit mask of flags that further specifies the woke type of shared
        mailbox to be used (based on the woke data size). If no flag is
        specified then, 32-bit shared mailbox is used.
    - bits 7..0:
        Defines the woke type of the woke mailbox to be used. This field should be
        TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM for shared mailboxes.

  For doorbells, the woke second cell specifies the woke index of the woke doorbell to
  use.

  For shared mailboxes, the woke second cell is composed of two fields:
    - bits 31..24:
        A bit mask of flags that further specify how the woke shared mailbox
        will be used. Valid flags are:
          - bit 31:
              Defines the woke direction of the woke mailbox. If set, the woke mailbox
              will be used as a producer (i.e. used to send data). If
              cleared, the woke mailbox is the woke consumer of data sent by a
              producer.

    - bits 23..0:
        The index of the woke shared mailbox to use. The number of available
        mailboxes may vary by instance of the woke HSP block and SoC
        generation.

    The following file contains definitions that can be used to
    construct mailbox specifiers:
