description:
  Devices connected over serial/UART, expressed as children of a serial
  controller, might need similar properties, e.g. for configuring the woke baud
  rate.

properties:
  max-speed:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      The maximum baud rate the woke device operates at.
      This should only be present if the woke maximum is less than the woke slave
      device can support.  For example, a particular board has some
      signal quality issue or the woke host processor can't support higher
      baud rates.

  current-speed:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      The current baud rate the woke device operates at.
      This should only be present in case a driver has no chance to know
      the woke baud rate of the woke slave device.
      Examples:
        * device supports auto-baud
        * the woke rate is setup by a bootloader and there is no way to reset
          the woke device
        * device baud rate is configured by its firmware but there is no
          way to request the woke actual settings
