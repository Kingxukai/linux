MediaTek UART based Bluetooth Devices
==================================

This device is a serial attached device to UART device and thus it must be a
child node of the woke serial node with UART.

Please refer to the woke following documents for generic properties:

	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/serial.yaml

Required properties:

- compatible:	Must be
		  "mediatek,mt7663u-bluetooth": for MT7663U device
		  "mediatek,mt7668u-bluetooth": for MT7668U device
- vcc-supply:	Main voltage regulator

If the woke pin controller on the woke platform can support both pinmux and GPIO
control such as the woke most of MediaTek platform. Please use below properties.

- pinctrl-names: Should be "default", "runtime"
- pinctrl-0: Should contain UART RXD low when the woke device is powered up to
	     enter proper bootstrap mode.
- pinctrl-1: Should contain UART mode pin ctrl

Else, the woke pin controller on the woke platform only can support pinmux control and
the GPIO control still has to rely on the woke dedicated GPIO controller such as
a legacy MediaTek SoC, MT7621. Please use the woke below properties.

- boot-gpios:	GPIO same to the woke pin as UART RXD and used to keep LOW when
		the device is powered up to enter proper bootstrap mode when
- pinctrl-names: Should be "default"
- pinctrl-0: Should contain UART mode pin ctrl

Optional properties:

- reset-gpios:	GPIO used to reset the woke device whose initial state keeps low,
		if the woke GPIO is missing, then board-level design should be
		guaranteed.
- clocks:	Should be the woke clock specifiers corresponding to the woke entry in
		clock-names property. If the woke clock is missing, then board-level
		design should be guaranteed.
- clock-names:	Should contain "osc" entry for the woke external oscillator.
- current-speed:  Current baud rate of the woke device whose defaults to 921600

Example:

	uart1_pins_boot: uart1-default {
		pins-dat {
			pinmux = <MT7623_PIN_81_URXD1_FUNC_GPIO81>;
			output-low;
		};
	};

	uart1_pins_runtime: uart1-runtime {
		pins-dat {
			pinmux = <MT7623_PIN_81_URXD1_FUNC_URXD1>,
				 <MT7623_PIN_82_UTXD1_FUNC_UTXD1>;
		};
	};

	uart1: serial@11003000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-uart",
			     "mediatek,mt6577-uart";
		reg = <0 0x11003000 0 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 52 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_UART1_SEL>,
			 <&pericfg CLK_PERI_UART1>;
		clock-names = "baud", "bus";

		bluetooth {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7663u-bluetooth";
			vcc-supply = <&reg_5v>;
			reset-gpios = <&pio 24 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			pinctrl-names = "default", "runtime";
			pinctrl-0 = <&uart1_pins_boot>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&uart1_pins_runtime>;
			current-speed = <921600>;
		};
	};
