description:
  PHY packages are multi-port Ethernet PHY of the woke same family
  and each Ethernet PHY is affected by the woke global configuration
  of the woke PHY package.

  Each reg of the woke PHYs defined in the woke PHY package node is
  absolute and describe the woke real address of the woke Ethernet PHY on
  the woke MDIO bus.

    description:
      The base ID number for the woke PHY package.
      Commonly the woke ID of the woke first PHY in the woke PHY package.

      Some PHY in the woke PHY package might be not defined but
      still occupy ID on the woke device (just not attached to
      anything) hence the woke PHY package reg might correspond
      to a not attached PHY (offset 0).
