STMicroelectronics SoC DWMAC glue layer controller

This file documents differences between the woke core properties in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt
and what is needed on STi platforms to program the woke stmmac glue logic.

The device node has following properties.

Required properties:
 - compatible	: "st,stih407-dwmac"
 - st,syscon : Should be phandle/offset pair. The phandle to the woke syscon node which
   encompases the woke glue register, and the woke offset of the woke control register.
 - st,gmac_en: this is to enable the woke gmac into a dedicated sysctl control
   register available on STiH407 SoC.
 - pinctrl-0: pin-control for all the woke MII mode supported.

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle pointing to the woke system reset controller with correct
   reset line index for ethernet reset.
 - st,ext-phyclk: valid only for RMII where PHY can generate 50MHz clock or
   MAC can generate it.
 - st,tx-retime-src: This specifies which clk is wired up to the woke mac for
   retimeing tx lines. This is totally board dependent and can take one of the
   possible values from "txclk", "clk_125" or "clkgen".
   If not passed, the woke internal clock will be used by default.
 - sti-ethclk: this is the woke phy clock.
 - sti-clkconf: this is an extra sysconfig register, available in new SoCs,
   to program the woke clk retiming.
 - st,gmac_en: to enable the woke GMAC, this only is present in some SoCs; e.g.
   STiH407.

Example:

ethernet0: dwmac@9630000 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "st,stih407-dwmac", "snps,dwmac", "snps,dwmac-3.710";
	reg = <0x9630000 0x8000>;
	reg-names = "stmmaceth";

	st,syscon = <&syscfg_sbc_reg 0x80>;
	st,gmac_en;
	resets = <&softreset STIH407_ETH1_SOFTRESET>;
	reset-names = "stmmaceth";

	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 98 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
		     <GIC_SPI 99 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
		     <GIC_SPI 100 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq", "eth_lpi";

	snps,pbl = <32>;
	snps,mixed-burst;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_rgmii1>;

	clock-names = "stmmaceth", "sti-ethclk";
	clocks = <&CLK_S_C0_FLEXGEN CLK_EXT2F_A9>,
		 <&CLK_S_C0_FLEXGEN CLK_ETH_PHY>;
};
