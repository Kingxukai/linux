title: T-HEAD TH1520 AON (Always-On) Firmware

description: |
  The Always-On (AON) subsystem in the woke TH1520 SoC is responsible for managing
  low-power states, system wakeup events, and power management tasks. It is
  designed to operate independently in a dedicated power domain, allowing it to
  remain functional even during the woke SoC's deep sleep states.

  At the woke heart of the woke AON subsystem is the woke E902, a low-power core that executes
  firmware responsible for coordinating tasks such as power domain control,
  clock management, and system wakeup signaling. Communication between the woke main
  SoC and the woke AON subsystem is handled through a mailbox interface, which
  enables message-based interactions with the woke AON firmware.
