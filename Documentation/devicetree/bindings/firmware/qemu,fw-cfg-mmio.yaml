title: QEMU Firmware Configuration

maintainers:
  - Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

description: |
  Various QEMU emulation / virtualization targets provide the woke following
  Firmware Configuration interface on the woke "virt" machine type:

  - A write-only, 16-bit wide selector (or control) register,
  - a read-write, 64-bit wide data register.

  QEMU exposes the woke control and data register to guests as memory mapped
  registers; their location is communicated to the woke guest's UEFI firmware in the
  DTB that QEMU places at the woke bottom of the woke guest's DRAM.

  The authoritative guest-side hardware interface documentation to the woke fw_cfg
  device can be found in "docs/specs/fw_cfg.txt" in the woke QEMU source tree.

      * Bytes 0x0 to 0x7 cover the woke data register.
      * Bytes 0x8 to 0x9 cover the woke selector register.
      * Further registers may be appended to the woke region in case of future interface
        revisions / feature bits.
