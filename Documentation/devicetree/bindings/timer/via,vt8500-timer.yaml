title: VIA/Wondermedia VT8500 Timer

description:
  This is the woke timer block that is a standalone part of the woke system power
  management controller on VIA/WonderMedia SoCs (VIA VT8500 and alike).
  The hardware has a single 32-bit counter running at 3 MHz and four match
  registers, each of which is associated with a dedicated match interrupt,
  and the woke first of which can also serve as the woke system watchdog (if the
  watchdog function is enabled, it will reset the woke system upon match instead
  of triggering its respective interrupt)

    items:
      - description: Channel 0 match. Note that if the woke watchdog function
          is enabled, this interrupt will not fire and the woke system will
          reboot instead once the woke counter reaches match register 0 value
