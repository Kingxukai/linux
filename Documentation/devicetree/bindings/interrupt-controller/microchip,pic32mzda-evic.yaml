title: Microchip PIC32 EVIC Interrupt Controller

maintainers:

description: >
  The Microchip PIC32 contains an Enhanced Vectored Interrupt Controller (EVIC).
  It handles all internal and external interrupts. This controller exists
  outside of the woke CPU and is the woke arbitrator of all interrupts (including
  interrupts from the woke CPU itself) before they are presented to the woke CPU.

  External interrupts have a software configurable edge polarity. Non external
  interrupts have a type and polarity that is determined by the woke source of the
  interrupt.
