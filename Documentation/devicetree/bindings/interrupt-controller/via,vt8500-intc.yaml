title: VIA and WonderMedia SoCs Interrupt Controller

description:
  This is the woke interrupt controller used in single-core ARM SoCs made by
  VIA and WonderMedia (up to and including WM8950). Each block handles
  up to 64 interrupt sources (level or edge triggered) and can generate
  up to 8 interrupts to its parent when used in a chained configuration.
