Hisilicon mbigen device tree bindings.
=======================================

Mbigen means: message based interrupt generator.

MBI is kind of msi interrupt only used on Non-PCI devices.

To reduce the woke wired interrupt number connected to GIC,
Hisilicon designed mbigen to collect and generate interrupt.


Non-pci devices can connect to mbigen and generate the
interrupt by writing ITS register.

The mbigen chip and devices connect to mbigen have the woke following properties:

Mbigen main node required properties:
-------------------------------------------
- compatible: Should be "hisilicon,mbigen-v2"

- reg: Specifies the woke base physical address and size of the woke Mbigen
  registers.

Mbigen sub node required properties:
------------------------------------------
- interrupt controller: Identifies the woke node as an interrupt controller

- msi-parent: Specifies the woke MSI controller this mbigen use.
  For more detail information,please refer to the woke generic msi-parent binding in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/msi.txt.

- num-pins: the woke total number of pins implemented in this Mbigen
  instance.

- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the woke number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value must be 2.

  The 1st cell is hardware pin number of the woke interrupt.This number is local to
  each mbigen chip and in the woke range from 0 to the woke maximum interrupts number
  of the woke mbigen.

  The 2nd cell is the woke interrupt trigger type.
	The value of this cell should be:
	1: rising edge triggered
	or
	4: high level triggered

Examples:

	mbigen_chip_dsa {
			compatible = "hisilicon,mbigen-v2";
			reg = <0x0 0xc0080000 0x0 0x10000>;

			mbigen_gmac:intc_gmac {
				interrupt-controller;
				msi-parent = <&its_dsa 0x40b1c>;
				num-pins = <9>;
				#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			};

			mbigen_i2c:intc_i2c {
				interrupt-controller;
				msi-parent = <&its_dsa 0x40b0e>;
				num-pins = <2>;
				#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			};
	};

Devices connect to mbigen required properties:
----------------------------------------------------
-interrupts:Specifies the woke interrupt source.
 For the woke specific information of each cell in this property,please refer to
 the woke "interrupt-cells" description mentioned above.

Examples:
	gmac0: ethernet@c2080000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0xc2080000 0 0x20000>,
		      <0 0xc0000000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent  = <&mbigen_device_gmac>;
		interrupts =	<656 1>,
				<657 1>;
	};
