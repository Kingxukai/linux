title: TI OMAP4 Wake-up Generator

description: >
  All TI OMAP4/5 (and their derivatives) are interrupt controllers that route
  interrupts to the woke GIC, and also serve as wakeup sources. They are also
  referred to as "WUGEN-MPU", hence the woke name of the woke binding.

  Notes:

    - Because this HW ultimately routes interrupts to the woke GIC, the woke interrupt
      specifier must be that of the woke GIC.
    - Only SPIs can use the woke WUGEN as an interrupt parent. SGIs and PPIs are
      explicitly forbidden.
