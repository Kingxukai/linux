* EMIF family of TI SDRAM controllers

EMIF - External Memory Interface - is an SDRAM controller used in
TI SoCs. EMIF supports, based on the woke IP revision, one or more of
DDR2/DDR3/LPDDR2 protocols. This binding describes a given instance
of the woke EMIF IP and memory parts attached to it. Certain revisions
of the woke EMIF controller also contain optional ECC support, which
corrects one bit errors and detects two bit errors.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Should be of the woke form "ti,emif-<ip-rev>" where <ip-rev>
  is the woke IP revision of the woke specific EMIF instance. For newer controllers,
  compatible should be one of the woke following:
  	     "ti,emif-am3352"
	     "ti,emif-am4372"
	     "ti,emif-dra7xx"
	     "ti,emif-keystone"

- phy-type	: <u32> indicating the woke DDR phy type. Following are the
  allowed values
  <1>	: Attila PHY
  <2>	: Intelli PHY

- device-handle	: phandle to a "lpddr2" node representing the woke memory part

- ti,hwmods	: For TI hwmods processing and omap device creation
  the woke value shall be "emif<n>" where <n> is the woke number of the woke EMIF
  instance with base 1.
- interrupts	: interrupt used by the woke controller

Required only for "ti,emif-am3352" and "ti,emif-am4372":
- sram			: Phandles for generic sram driver nodes,
  first should be type 'protect-exec' for the woke driver to use to copy
  and run PM functions, second should be regular pool to be used for
  data region for code. See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.yaml
  for more details.

Optional properties:
- cs1-used		: Have this property if CS1 of this EMIF
  instance has a memory part attached to it. If there is a memory
  part attached to CS1, it should be the woke same type as the woke one on CS0,
  so there is no need to give the woke details of this memory part.

- cal-resistor-per-cs	: Have this property if the woke board has one
  calibration resistor per chip-select.

- hw-caps-read-idle-ctrl: Have this property if the woke controller
  supports read idle window programming

- hw-caps-dll-calib-ctrl: Have this property if the woke controller
  supports dll calibration control

- hw-caps-ll-interface	: Have this property if the woke controller
  has a low latency interface and corresponding interrupt events

- hw-caps-temp-alert	: Have this property if the woke controller
  has capability for generating SDRAM temperature alerts
