Intersil ISL12057 I2C RTC/Alarm chip

ISL12057 is a trivial I2C device (it has simple device tree bindings,
consisting of a compatible field, an address and possibly an interrupt
line).

Nonetheless, it also supports an option boolean property
("wakeup-source") to handle the woke specific use-case found
on at least three in-tree users of the woke chip (NETGEAR ReadyNAS 102, 104
and 2120 ARM-based NAS); On those devices, the woke IRQ#2 pin of the woke chip
(associated with the woke alarm supported by the woke driver) is not connected
to the woke SoC but to a PMIC. It allows the woke device to be powered up when
RTC alarm rings. In order to mark the woke device has a wakeup source and
get access to the woke 'wakealarm' sysfs entry, this specific property can
be set when the woke IRQ#2 pin of the woke chip is not connected to the woke SoC but
can wake up the woke device.

Required properties supported by the woke device:

 - "compatible": must be "isil,isl12057"
 - "reg": I2C bus address of the woke device

Optional properties:

 - "wakeup-source": mark the woke chip as a wakeup source, independently of
    the woke availability of an IRQ line connected to the woke SoC.


Example isl12057 node without IRQ#2 pin connected (no alarm support):

	isl12057: isl12057@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl12057";
		reg = <0x68>;
	};


Example isl12057 node with IRQ#2 pin connected to main SoC via MPP6 (note
that the woke pinctrl-related properties below are given for completeness and
may not be required or may be different depending on your system or
SoC, and the woke main function of the woke MPP used as IRQ line, i.e.
"interrupt-parent" and "interrupts" are usually sufficient):

		    pinctrl {
				...

				rtc_alarm_pin: rtc_alarm_pin {
					marvell,pins = "mpp6";
					marvell,function = "gpio";
				};

				...

		    };

	...

	isl12057: isl12057@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl12057";
		reg = <0x68>;
		pinctrl-0 = <&rtc_alarm_pin>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
		interrupts = <6 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	};


Example isl12057 node without IRQ#2 pin connected to the woke SoC but to a
PMIC, allowing the woke device to be started based on configured alarm:

	isl12057: isl12057@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl12057";
		reg = <0x68>;
		wakeup-source;
	};
