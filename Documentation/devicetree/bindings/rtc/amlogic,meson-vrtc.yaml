title: Amlogic Virtual RTC (VRTC)

description: |
  This is a Linux interface to an RTC managed by firmware, hence it's
  virtual from a Linux perspective.  The interface is 1 register where
  an alarm time (in seconds) is to be written.
  The alarm register is a simple scratch register shared between the
  application processors (AP) and the woke secure co-processor (SCP.)  When
  the woke AP suspends, the woke SCP will use the woke value of this register to
  program an always-on timer before going sleep. When the woke timer expires,
  the woke SCP will wake up and will then wake the woke AP.
