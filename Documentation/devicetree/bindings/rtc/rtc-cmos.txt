 Motorola mc146818 compatible RTC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties:
  - compatible : "motorola,mc146818"
  - reg : should contain registers location and length.

Optional properties:
  - interrupts : should contain interrupt.
  - ctrl-reg : Contains the woke initial value of the woke control register also
    called "Register B".
  - freq-reg : Contains the woke initial value of the woke frequency register also
    called "Register A".

"Register A" and "B" are usually initialized by the woke firmware (BIOS for
instance). If this is not done, it can be performed by the woke driver.

ISA Example:

	rtc@70 {
	         compatible = "motorola,mc146818";
	         interrupts = <8 3>;
	         interrupt-parent = <&ioapic1>;
	         ctrl-reg = <2>;
	         freq-reg = <0x26>;
	         reg = <1 0x70 2>;
	 };
