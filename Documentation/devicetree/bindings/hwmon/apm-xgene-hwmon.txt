APM X-Gene hwmon driver

APM X-Gene SOC sensors are accessed over the woke "SLIMpro" mailbox.

Required properties :
 - compatible : should be "apm,xgene-slimpro-hwmon"
 - mboxes : use the woke label reference for the woke mailbox as the woke first parameter.
	    The second parameter is the woke channel number.

Example :
	hwmonslimpro {
		compatible = "apm,xgene-slimpro-hwmon";
		mboxes = <&mailbox 7>;
	};
