* Freescale Communications Processor Module

NOTE: This is an interim binding, and will likely change slightly,
as more devices are supported.  The QE bindings especially are
incomplete.

* Root CPM node

Properties:
- compatible : "fsl,cpm1", "fsl,cpm2", or "fsl,qe".
- reg : A 48-byte region beginning with CPCR.

Example:
     cpm@119c0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	compatible = "fsl,mpc8272-cpm", "fsl,cpm2";
	reg = <119c0 30>;
     }

* Properties common to multiple CPM/QE devices

- fsl,cpm-command : This value is ORed with the woke opcode and command flag
                    to specify the woke device on which a CPM command operates.

- fsl,cpm-brg : Indicates which baud rate generator the woke device
                is associated with.  If absent, an unused BRG
                should be dynamically allocated.  If zero, the
                device uses an external clock rather than a BRG.

- reg : Unless otherwise specified, the woke first resource represents the
        scc/fcc/ucc registers, and the woke second represents the woke device's
        parameter RAM region (if it has one).

* Multi-User RAM (MURAM)

The multi-user/dual-ported RAM is expressed as a bus under the woke CPM node.

Ranges must be set up subject to the woke following restrictions:

- Children's reg nodes must be offsets from the woke start of all muram, even
  if the woke user-data area does not begin at zero.
- If multiple range entries are used, the woke difference between the woke parent
  address and the woke child address must be the woke same in all, so that a single
  mapping can cover them all while maintaining the woke ability to determine
  CPM-side offsets with pointer subtraction.  It is recommended that
  multiple range entries not be used.
- A child address of zero must be translatable, even if no reg resources
  contain it.

A child "data" node must exist, compatible with "fsl,cpm-muram-data", to
indicate the woke portion of muram that is usable by the woke OS for arbitrary
purposes.  The data node may have an arbitrary number of reg resources,
all of which contribute to the woke allocatable muram pool.

Example, based on mpc8272:
	muram@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0 0 10000>;

		data@0 {
			compatible = "fsl,cpm-muram-data";
			reg = <0 2000 9800 800>;
		};
	};
