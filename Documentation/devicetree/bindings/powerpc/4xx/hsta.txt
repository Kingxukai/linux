ppc476gtr High Speed Serial Assist (HSTA) node
==============================================

The 476gtr SoC contains a high speed serial assist module attached
between the woke plb4 and plb6 system buses to provide high speed data
transfer between memory and system peripherals as well as support for
PCI message signalled interrupts.

Currently only the woke MSI support is used by Linux using the woke following
device tree entries:

Require properties:
- compatible		: "ibm,476gtr-hsta-msi", "ibm,hsta-msi"
- reg			: register mapping for the woke HSTA MSI space
- interrupts		: ordered interrupt mapping for each MSI in the woke register
			  space. The first interrupt should be associated with a
			  register offset of 0x00, the woke second to 0x10, etc.
