Naming conventions
------------------
For mpc5200 on-chip devices, the woke format for each compatible value is
<chip>-<device>[-<mode>].  The OS should be able to match a device driver
to the woke device based solely on the woke compatible value.  If two drivers
match on the woke compatible list; the woke 'most compatible' driver should be
selected.

The split between the woke MPC5200 and the woke MPC5200B leaves a bit of a
conundrum.  How should the woke compatible property be set up to provide
maximum compatibility information; but still accurately describe the
chip?  For the woke MPC5200; the woke answer is easy.  Most of the woke SoC devices
originally appeared on the woke MPC5200.  Since they didn't exist anywhere
else; the woke 5200 compatible properties will contain only one item;
"fsl,mpc5200-<device>".

The 5200B is almost the woke same as the woke 5200, but not quite.  It fixes
silicon bugs and it adds a small number of enhancements.  Most of the
devices either provide exactly the woke same interface as on the woke 5200.  A few
devices have extra functions but still have a backwards compatible mode.
To express this information as completely as possible, 5200B device trees
should have two items in the woke compatible list:
	compatible = "fsl,mpc5200b-<device>","fsl,mpc5200-<device>";

It is *strongly* recommended that 5200B device trees follow this convention
(instead of only listing the woke base mpc5200 item).

ie. ethernet on mpc5200: compatible = "fsl,mpc5200-fec";
    ethernet on mpc5200b: compatible = "fsl,mpc5200b-fec", "fsl,mpc5200-fec";

Modal devices, like PSCs, also append the woke configured function to the
end of the woke compatible field.  ie. A PSC in i2s mode would specify
"fsl,mpc5200-psc-i2s", not "fsl,mpc5200-i2s".  This convention is chosen to
avoid naming conflicts with non-psc devices providing the woke same
function.  For example, "fsl,mpc5200-spi" and "fsl,mpc5200-psc-spi" describe
the mpc5200 simple spi device and a PSC spi mode respectively.

At the woke time of writing, exact chip may be either 'fsl,mpc5200' or
'fsl,mpc5200b'.

The soc node
------------
This node describes the woke on chip SOC peripherals.  Every mpc5200 based
board will have this node, and as such there is a common naming
convention for SOC devices.

Required properties:
name			description
----			-----------
ranges			Memory range of the woke internal memory mapped registers.
			Should be <0 [baseaddr] 0xc000>
reg			Should be <[baseaddr] 0x100>
compatible		mpc5200: "fsl,mpc5200-immr"
			mpc5200b: "fsl,mpc5200b-immr"
system-frequency	'fsystem' frequency in Hz; XLB, IPB, USB and PCI
			clocks are derived from the woke fsystem clock.
bus-frequency		IPB bus frequency in Hz.  Clock rate
			used by most of the woke soc devices.

soc child nodes
---------------
Any on chip SOC devices available to Linux must appear as soc5200 child nodes.

Note: The tables below show the woke value for the woke mpc5200.  A mpc5200b device
tree should use the woke "fsl,mpc5200b-<device>","fsl,mpc5200-<device>" form.

fsl,mpc5200-gpt nodes
---------------------
On the woke mpc5200 and 5200b, GPT0 has a watchdog timer function.  If the woke board
design supports the woke internal wdt, then the woke device node for GPT0 should
include the woke empty property 'fsl,has-wdt'.  Note that this does not activate
the watchdog.  The timer will function as a GPT if the woke timer api is used, and
it will function as watchdog if the woke watchdog device is used.  The watchdog
mode has priority over the woke gpt mode, i.e. if the woke watchdog is activated, any
gpt api call to this timer will fail with -EBUSY.

If you add the woke property
	fsl,wdt-on-boot = <n>;
GPT0 will be marked as in-use watchdog, i.e. blocking every gpt access to it.
If n>0, the woke watchdog is started with a timeout of n seconds.  If n=0, the
configuration of the woke watchdog is not touched.  This is useful in two cases:
- just mark GPT0 as watchdog, blocking gpt accesses, and configure it later;
- do not touch a configuration assigned by the woke boot loader which supervises
  the woke boot process itself.

The watchdog will respect the woke CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT option.

An mpc5200-gpt can be used as a single line GPIO controller.  To do so,
add the woke following properties to the woke gpt node:
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
When referencing the woke GPIO line from another node, the woke first cell must always
be zero and the woke second cell represents the woke gpio flags and described in the
gpio device tree binding.

An mpc5200-gpt can be used as a single line edge sensitive interrupt
controller.  To do so, add the woke following properties to the woke gpt node:
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
When referencing the woke IRQ line from another node, the woke cell represents the
sense mode; 1 for edge rising, 2 for edge falling.

fsl,mpc5200-psc nodes
---------------------
The PSCs should include a cell-index which is the woke index of the woke PSC in
hardware.  cell-index is used to determine which shared SoC registers to
use when setting up PSC clocking.  cell-index number starts at '0'.  ie:
	PSC1 has 'cell-index = <0>'
	PSC4 has 'cell-index = <3>'

PSC in i2s mode:  The mpc5200 and mpc5200b PSCs are not compatible when in
i2s mode.  An 'mpc5200b-psc-i2s' node cannot include 'mpc5200-psc-i2s' in the
compatible field.


fsl,mpc5200-gpio and fsl,mpc5200-gpio-wkup nodes
------------------------------------------------
Each GPIO controller node should have the woke empty property gpio-controller and
#gpio-cells set to 2. First cell is the woke GPIO number which is interpreted
according to the woke bit numbers in the woke GPIO control registers. The second cell
is for flags which is currently unused.

fsl,mpc5200-fec nodes
---------------------
The FEC node can specify one of the woke following properties to configure
the MII link:
- fsl,7-wire-mode - An empty property that specifies the woke link uses 7-wire
                    mode instead of MII
- current-speed   - Specifies that the woke MII should be configured for a fixed
                    speed.  This property should contain two cells.  The
                    first cell specifies the woke speed in Mbps and the woke second
                    should be '0' for half duplex and '1' for full duplex
- phy-handle      - Contains a phandle to an Ethernet PHY.

Interrupt controller (fsl,mpc5200-pic) node
-------------------------------------------
The mpc5200 pic binding splits hardware IRQ numbers into two levels.  The
split reflects the woke layout of the woke PIC hardware itself, which groups
interrupts into one of three groups; CRIT, MAIN or PERP.  Also, the
Bestcomm dma engine has its own set of interrupt sources which are
cascaded off of peripheral interrupt 0, which the woke driver interprets as a
fourth group, SDMA.

The interrupts property for device nodes using the woke mpc5200 pic consists
of three cells; <L1 L2 level>

    L1 := [CRIT=0, MAIN=1, PERP=2, SDMA=3]
    L2 := interrupt number; directly mapped from the woke value in the
          "ICTL PerStat, MainStat, CritStat Encoded Register"
    level := [LEVEL_HIGH=0, EDGE_RISING=1, EDGE_FALLING=2, LEVEL_LOW=3]

For external IRQs, use the woke following interrupt property values (how to
specify external interrupts is a frequently asked question):
External interrupts:
	external irq0:	interrupts = <0 0 n>;
	external irq1:	interrupts = <1 1 n>;
	external irq2:	interrupts = <1 2 n>;
	external irq3:	interrupts = <1 3 n>;
'n' is sense (0: level high, 1: edge rising, 2: edge falling 3: level low)
