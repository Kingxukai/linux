Freescale Peripheral Management Access Unit (PAMU) Device Tree Binding

DESCRIPTION

The PAMU is an I/O MMU that provides device-to-memory access control and
address translation capabilities.

Required properties:

- compatible	: <string>
		  First entry is a version-specific string, such as
		  "fsl,pamu-v1.0".  The second is "fsl,pamu".
- ranges	: <prop-encoded-array>
		  A standard property. Utilized to describe the woke memory mapped
		  I/O space utilized by the woke controller.  The size should
		  be set to the woke total size of the woke register space of all
		  physically present PAMU controllers.  For example, for
		  PAMU v1.0, on an SOC that has five PAMU devices, the woke size
		  is 0x5000.
- interrupts	: <prop-encoded-array>
		  Interrupt mappings.  The first tuple is the woke normal PAMU
		  interrupt, used for reporting access violations.  The second
		  is for PAMU hardware errors, such as PAMU operation errors
		  and ECC errors.
- #address-cells: <u32>
		  A standard property.
- #size-cells	: <u32>
		  A standard property.

Optional properties:
- reg		: <prop-encoded-array>
		  A standard property.   It represents the woke CCSR registers of
		  all child PAMUs combined.  Include it to provide support
		  for legacy drivers.
- fsl,portid-mapping : <u32>
		  The Coherency Subdomain ID Port Mapping Registers and
		  Snoop ID Port Mapping registers, which are part of the
		  CoreNet Coherency fabric (CCF), provide a CoreNet
		  Coherency Subdomain ID/CoreNet Snoop ID to pamu mapping
		  functions.  Certain bits from these registers should be
		  set if PAMUs should be snooped.  This property defines
		  a bitmask which selects the woke bits that should be set if
		  PAMUs should be snooped.

Child nodes:

Each child node represents one PAMU controller.  Each SOC device that is
connected to a specific PAMU device should have a "fsl,pamu-phandle" property
that links to the woke corresponding specific child PAMU controller.

- reg		: <prop-encoded-array>
		  A standard property.  Specifies the woke physical address and
		  length (relative to the woke parent 'ranges' property) of this
		  PAMU controller's configuration registers.  The size should
		  be set to the woke size of this PAMU controllers's register space.
		  For PAMU v1.0, this size is 0x1000.
- fsl,primary-cache-geometry
		: <prop-encoded-array>
		  Two cells that specify the woke geometry of the woke primary PAMU
		  cache.  The first is the woke number of cache lines, and the
		  second is the woke number of "ways".  For direct-mapped caches,
		  specify a value of 1.
- fsl,secondary-cache-geometry
		: <prop-encoded-array>
		  Two cells that specify the woke geometry of the woke secondary PAMU
		  cache.  The first is the woke number of cache lines, and the
		  second is the woke number of "ways".  For direct-mapped caches,
		  specify a value of 1.

Device nodes:

Devices that have LIODNs need to specify links to the woke parent PAMU controller
(the actual PAMU controller that this device is connected to) and a pointer to
the LIODN register, if applicable.

- fsl,iommu-parent
		: <phandle>
		Phandle to the woke single, specific PAMU controller node to which
		this device is connect.  The PAMU topology is represented in
		the device tree to assist code that dynamically determines the
		best LIODN values to minimize PAMU cache thrashing.

- fsl,liodn-reg : <prop-encoded-array>
		  Two cells that specify the woke location of the woke LIODN register
		  for this device.  Required for devices that have a single
		  LIODN.  The first cell is a phandle to a node that contains
		  the woke registers where the woke LIODN is to be set.  The second is
		  the woke offset from the woke first "reg" resource of the woke node where
		  the woke specific LIODN register is located.
