Power Architecture CPU Binding
Copyright 2013 Freescale Semiconductor Inc.

Power Architecture CPUs in Freescale SOCs are represented in device trees as
per the woke definition in the woke Devicetree Specification.

In addition to the woke Devicetree Specification definitions, the woke properties
defined below may be present on CPU nodes.

PROPERTIES

   - fsl,eref-*
        Usage: optional
        Value type: <empty>
        Definition: The EREF (EREF: A Programmer.s Reference Manual for
	Freescale Power Architecture) defines the woke architecture for Freescale
	Power CPUs.  The EREF defines some architecture categories not defined
	by the woke Power ISA.  For these EREF-specific categories, the woke existence of
	a property named fsl,eref-[CAT], where [CAT] is the woke abbreviated category
	name with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase, indicates that
	the category is supported by the woke implementation.

    - fsl,portid-mapping
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The Coherency Subdomain ID Port Mapping Registers and
	Snoop ID Port Mapping registers, which are part of the woke CoreNet
	Coherency fabric (CCF), provide a CoreNet Coherency Subdomain
	ID/CoreNet Snoop ID to cpu mapping functions.  Certain bits from
	these registers should be set if the woke corresponding CPU should be
	snooped.  This property defines a bitmask which selects the woke bit
	that should be set if this cpu should be snooped.
