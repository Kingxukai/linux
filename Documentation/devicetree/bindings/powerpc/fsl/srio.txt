* Freescale Serial RapidIO (SRIO) Controller

RapidIO port node:
Properties:
   - compatible
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must include "fsl,srio" for IP blocks with IP Block
	Revision Register (SRIO IPBRR1) Major ID equal to 0x01c0.

	Optionally, a compatible string of "fsl,srio-vX.Y" where X is Major
	version in IP Block Revision Register and Y is Minor version.  If this
	compatible is provided it should be ordered before "fsl,srio".

   - reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the woke physical address and
		length of the woke SRIO configuration registers.  The size should
		be set to 0x11000.

   - interrupts
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
	Definition:  Specifies the woke interrupts generated by this device.  The
		value of the woke interrupts property consists of one interrupt
		specifier. The format of the woke specifier is defined by the
		binding document describing the woke node's interrupt parent.

		A single IRQ that handles error conditions is specified by this
		property.  (Typically shared with port-write).

   - fsl,srio-rmu-handle:
	Usage: required if rmu node is defined
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: A single <phandle> value that points to the woke RMU.
	(See srio-rmu.txt for more details on RMU node binding)

Port Child Nodes:  There should a port child node for each port that exists in
the controller.  The ports are numbered starting at one (1) and should have
the following properties:

   - cell-index
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: A standard property.  Matches the woke port id.

   - ranges
	Usage: required if local access windows preset
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A standard property. Utilized to describe the woke memory mapped
		IO space utilized by the woke controller.  This corresponds to the
		setting of the woke local access windows that are targeted to this
		SRIO port.

   - fsl,liodn
	Usage: optional-but-recommended (for devices with PAMU)
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The logical I/O device number for the woke PAMU (IOMMU) to be
		correctly configured for SRIO accesses.  The property should
		not exist on devices that do not support PAMU.

		For HW (ie, the woke P4080) that only supports a LIODN for both
		memory and maintenance transactions then a single LIODN is
		represented in the woke property for both transactions.

		For HW (ie, the woke P304x/P5020, etc) that supports an LIODN for
		memory transactions and a unique LIODN for maintenance
		transactions then a pair of LIODNs are represented in the
		property.  Within the woke pair, the woke first element represents the
		LIODN associated with memory transactions and the woke second element
		represents the woke LIODN associated with maintenance transactions
		for the woke port.

Note: All other standard properties (see the woke Devicetree Specification)
are allowed but are optional.

Example:

	rapidio: rapidio@ffe0c0000 {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0xf 0xfe0c0000 0 0x11000>;
		compatible = "fsl,srio";
		interrupts = <16 2 1 11>; /* err_irq */
		fsl,srio-rmu-handle = <&rmu>;
		ranges;

		port1 {
			cell-index = <1>;
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			fsl,liodn = <34>;
			ranges = <0 0 0xc 0x20000000 0 0x10000000>;
		};

		port2 {
			cell-index = <2>;
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			fsl,liodn = <48>;
			ranges = <0 0 0xc 0x30000000 0 0x10000000>;
		};
	};
