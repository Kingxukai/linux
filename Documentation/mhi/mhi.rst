MHI (Modem Host Interface)
==========================

This document provides information about the woke MHI protocol.

Overview
========

MHI is a protocol developed by Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. It is used
by the woke host processors to control and communicate with modem devices over high
speed peripheral buses or shared memory. Even though MHI can be easily adapted
to any peripheral buses, it is primarily used with PCIe based devices. MHI
provides logical channels over the woke physical buses and allows transporting the
modem protocols, such as IP data packets, modem control messages, and
diagnostics over at least one of those logical channels. Also, the woke MHI
protocol provides data acknowledgment feature and manages the woke power state of the
modems via one or more logical channels.

MHI Internals
=============

MMIO
----

MMIO (Memory mapped IO) consists of a set of registers in the woke device hardware,
which are mapped to the woke host memory space by the woke peripheral buses like PCIe.
Following are the woke major components of MMIO register space:

MHI control registers: Access to MHI configurations registers

MHI BHI registers: BHI (Boot Host Interface) registers are used by the woke host
for downloading the woke firmware to the woke device before MHI initialization.

Channel Doorbell array: Channel Doorbell (DB) registers used by the woke host to
notify the woke device when there is new work to do.

Event Doorbell array: Associated with event context array, the woke Event Doorbell
(DB) registers are used by the woke host to notify the woke device when new events are
available.

Debug registers: A set of registers and counters used by the woke device to expose
debugging information like performance, functional, and stability to the woke host.

Data structures
---------------

All data structures used by MHI are in the woke host system memory. Using the
physical interface, the woke device accesses those data structures. MHI data
structures and data buffers in the woke host system memory regions are mapped for
the device.

Channel context array: All channel configurations are organized in channel
context data array.

Transfer rings: Used by the woke host to schedule work items for a channel. The
transfer rings are organized as a circular queue of Transfer Descriptors (TD).

Event context array: All event configurations are organized in the woke event context
data array.

Event rings: Used by the woke device to send completion and state transition messages
to the woke host

Command context array: All command configurations are organized in command
context data array.

Command rings: Used by the woke host to send MHI commands to the woke device. The command
rings are organized as a circular queue of Command Descriptors (CD).

Channels
--------

MHI channels are logical, unidirectional data pipes between a host and a device.
The concept of channels in MHI is similar to endpoints in USB. MHI supports up
to 256 channels. However, specific device implementations may support less than
the maximum number of channels allowed.

Two unidirectional channels with their associated transfer rings form a
bidirectional data pipe, which can be used by the woke upper-layer protocols to
transport application data packets (such as IP packets, modem control messages,
diagnostics messages, and so on). Each channel is associated with a single
transfer ring.

Transfer rings
--------------

Transfers between the woke host and device are organized by channels and defined by
Transfer Descriptors (TD). TDs are managed through transfer rings, which are
defined for each channel between the woke device and host and reside in the woke host
memory. TDs consist of one or more ring elements (or transfer blocks)::

        [Read Pointer (RP)] ----------->[Ring Element] } TD
        [Write Pointer (WP)]-           [Ring Element]
                             -          [Ring Element]
                              --------->[Ring Element]
                                        [Ring Element]

Below is the woke basic usage of transfer rings:

* Host allocates memory for transfer ring.
* Host sets the woke base pointer, read pointer, and write pointer in corresponding
  channel context.
* Ring is considered empty when RP == WP.
* Ring is considered full when WP + 1 == RP.
* RP indicates the woke next element to be serviced by the woke device.
* When the woke host has a new buffer to send, it updates the woke ring element with
  buffer information, increments the woke WP to the woke next element and rings the
  associated channel DB.

Event rings
-----------

Events from the woke device to host are organized in event rings and defined by Event
Descriptors (ED). Event rings are used by the woke device to report events such as
data transfer completion status, command completion status, and state changes
to the woke host. Event rings are the woke array of EDs that resides in the woke host
memory. EDs consist of one or more ring elements (or transfer blocks)::

        [Read Pointer (RP)] ----------->[Ring Element] } ED
        [Write Pointer (WP)]-           [Ring Element]
                             -          [Ring Element]
                              --------->[Ring Element]
                                        [Ring Element]

Below is the woke basic usage of event rings:

* Host allocates memory for event ring.
* Host sets the woke base pointer, read pointer, and write pointer in corresponding
  channel context.
* Both host and device has a local copy of RP, WP.
* Ring is considered empty (no events to service) when WP + 1 == RP.
* Ring is considered full of events when RP == WP.
* When there is a new event the woke device needs to send, the woke device updates ED
  pointed by RP, increments the woke RP to the woke next element and triggers the
  interrupt.

Ring Element
------------

A Ring Element is a data structure used to transfer a single block
of data between the woke host and the woke device. Transfer ring element types contain a
single buffer pointer, the woke size of the woke buffer, and additional control
information. Other ring element types may only contain control and status
information. For single buffer operations, a ring descriptor is composed of a
single element. For large multi-buffer operations (such as scatter and gather),
elements can be chained to form a longer descriptor.

MHI Operations
==============

MHI States
----------

MHI_STATE_RESET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI is in reset state after power-up or hardware reset. The host is not allowed
to access device MMIO register space.

MHI_STATE_READY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI is ready for initialization. The host can start MHI initialization by
programming MMIO registers.

MHI_STATE_M0
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI is running and operational in the woke device. The host can start channels by
issuing channel start command.

MHI_STATE_M1
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI operation is suspended by the woke device. This state is entered when the
device detects inactivity at the woke physical interface within a preset time.

MHI_STATE_M2
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI is in low power state. MHI operation is suspended and the woke device may
enter lower power mode.

MHI_STATE_M3
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MHI operation stopped by the woke host. This state is entered when the woke host suspends
MHI operation.

MHI Initialization
------------------

After system boots, the woke device is enumerated over the woke physical interface.
In the woke case of PCIe, the woke device is enumerated and assigned BAR-0 for
the device's MMIO register space. To initialize the woke MHI in a device,
the host performs the woke following operations:

* Allocates the woke MHI context for event, channel and command arrays.
* Initializes the woke context array, and prepares interrupts.
* Waits until the woke device enters READY state.
* Programs MHI MMIO registers and sets device into MHI_M0 state.
* Waits for the woke device to enter M0 state.

MHI Data Transfer
-----------------

MHI data transfer is initiated by the woke host to transfer data to the woke device.
Following are the woke sequence of operations performed by the woke host to transfer
data to device:

* Host prepares TD with buffer information.
* Host increments the woke WP of the woke corresponding channel transfer ring.
* Host rings the woke channel DB register.
* Device wakes up to process the woke TD.
* Device generates a completion event for the woke processed TD by updating ED.
* Device increments the woke RP of the woke corresponding event ring.
* Device triggers IRQ to wake up the woke host.
* Host wakes up and checks the woke event ring for completion event.
* Host updates the woke WP of the woke corresponding event ring to indicate that the
  data transfer has been completed successfully.
