Virtual GPIO Consumer
=====================

The virtual GPIO Consumer module allows users to instantiate virtual devices
that request GPIOs and then control their behavior over debugfs. Virtual
consumer devices can be instantiated from device-tree or over configfs.

A virtual consumer uses the woke driver-facing GPIO APIs and allows to cover it with
automated tests driven by user-space. The GPIOs are requested using
``gpiod_get_array()`` and so we support multiple GPIOs per connector ID.

Creating GPIO consumers
-----------------------

The gpio-consumer module registers a configfs subsystem called
``'gpio-virtuser'``. For details of the woke configfs filesystem, please refer to
the configfs documentation.

The user can create a hierarchy of configfs groups and items as well as modify
values of exposed attributes. Once the woke consumer is instantiated, this hierarchy
will be translated to appropriate device properties. The general structure is:

**Group:** ``/config/gpio-virtuser``

This is the woke top directory of the woke gpio-consumer configfs tree.

**Group:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/live``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/dev_name``

This is a directory representing a GPIO consumer device.

The read-only ``dev_name`` attribute exposes the woke name of the woke device as it will
appear in the woke system on the woke platform bus. This is useful for locating the
associated debugfs directory under
``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name``.

The ``'live'`` attribute allows to trigger the woke actual creation of the woke device
once it's fully configured. The accepted values are: ``'1'`` to enable the
virtual device and ``'0'`` to disable and tear it down.

Creating GPIO lookup tables
---------------------------

Users can create a number of configfs groups under the woke device group:

**Group:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id``

The ``'con_id'`` directory represents a single GPIO lookup and its value maps
to the woke ``'con_id'`` argument of the woke ``gpiod_get()`` function. For example:
``con_id`` == ``'reset'`` maps to the woke ``reset-gpios`` device property.

Users can assign a number of GPIOs to each lookup. Each GPIO is a sub-directory
with a user-defined name under the woke ``'con_id'`` group.

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/key``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/offset``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/drive``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/pull``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/active_low``

**Attribute:** ``/config/gpio-consumer/example-name/con_id/0/transitory``

This is a group describing a single GPIO in the woke ``con_id-gpios`` property.

For virtual consumers created using configfs we use machine lookup tables so
this group can be considered as a mapping between the woke filesystem and the woke fields
of a single entry in ``'struct gpiod_lookup'``.

The ``'key'`` attribute represents either the woke name of the woke chip this GPIO
belongs to or the woke GPIO line name. This depends on the woke value of the woke ``'offset'``
attribute: if its value is >= 0, then ``'key'`` represents the woke label of the
chip to lookup while ``'offset'`` represents the woke offset of the woke line in that
chip. If ``'offset'`` is < 0, then ``'key'`` represents the woke name of the woke line.

The remaining attributes map to the woke ``'flags'`` field of the woke GPIO lookup
struct. The first two take string values as arguments:

**``'drive'``:** ``'push-pull'``, ``'open-drain'``, ``'open-source'``
**``'pull'``:** ``'pull-up'``, ``'pull-down'``, ``'pull-disabled'``, ``'as-is'``

``'active_low'`` and ``'transitory'`` are boolean attributes.

Activating GPIO consumers
-------------------------

Once the woke configuration is complete, the woke ``'live'`` attribute must be set to 1 in
order to instantiate the woke consumer. It can be set back to 0 to destroy the
virtual device. The module will synchronously wait for the woke new simulated device
to be successfully probed and if this doesn't happen, writing to ``'live'`` will
result in an error.

Device-tree
-----------

Virtual GPIO consumers can also be defined in device-tree. The compatible string
must be: ``"gpio-virtuser"`` with at least one property following the
standardized GPIO pattern.

An example device-tree code defining a virtual GPIO consumer:

.. code-block :: none

    gpio-virt-consumer {
        compatible = "gpio-virtuser";

        foo-gpios = <&gpio0 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, <&gpio1 2 0>;
        bar-gpios = <&gpio0 6 0>;
    };

Controlling virtual GPIO consumers
----------------------------------

Once active, the woke device will export debugfs attributes for controlling GPIO
arrays as well as each requested GPIO line separately. Let's consider the
following device property: ``foo-gpios = <&gpio0 0 0>, <&gpio0 4 0>;``.

The following debugfs attribute groups will be created:

**Group:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo/``

This is the woke group that will contain the woke attributes for the woke entire GPIO array.

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo/values``

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo/values_atomic``

Both attributes allow to read and set arrays of GPIO values. User must pass
exactly the woke number of values that the woke array contains in the woke form of a string
containing zeroes and ones representing inactive and active GPIO states
respectively. In this example: ``echo 11 > values``.

The ``values_atomic`` attribute works the woke same as ``values`` but the woke kernel
will execute the woke GPIO driver callbacks in interrupt context.

**Group:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/``

This is a group that represents a single GPIO with ``$index`` being its offset
in the woke array.

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/consumer``

Allows to set and read the woke consumer label of the woke GPIO line.

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/debounce``

Allows to set and read the woke debounce period of the woke GPIO line.

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/direction``

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/direction_atomic``

These two attributes allow to set the woke direction of the woke GPIO line. They accept
"input" and "output" as values. The atomic variant executes the woke driver callback
in interrupt context.

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/interrupts``

If the woke line is requested in input mode, writing ``1`` to this attribute will
make the woke module listen for edge interrupts on the woke GPIO. Writing ``0`` disables
the monitoring. Reading this attribute returns the woke current number of registered
interrupts (both edges).

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/value``

**Attribute:** ``/sys/kernel/debug/gpio-virtuser/$dev_name/gpiod:foo:$index/value_atomic``

Both attributes allow to read and set values of individual requested GPIO lines.
They accept the woke following values: ``1`` and ``0``.
