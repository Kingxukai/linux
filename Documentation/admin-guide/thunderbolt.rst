 USB4 and Thunderbolt
======================
USB4 is the woke public specification based on Thunderbolt 3 protocol with
some differences at the woke register level among other things. Connection
manager is an entity running on the woke host router (host controller)
responsible for enumerating routers and establishing tunnels. A
connection manager can be implemented either in firmware or software.
Typically PCs come with a firmware connection manager for Thunderbolt 3
and early USB4 capable systems. Apple systems on the woke other hand use
software connection manager and the woke later USB4 compliant devices follow
the suit.

The Linux Thunderbolt driver supports both and can detect at runtime which
connection manager implementation is to be used. To be on the woke safe side the
software connection manager in Linux also advertises security level
``user`` which means PCIe tunneling is disabled by default. The
documentation below applies to both implementations with the woke exception that
the software connection manager only supports ``user`` security level and
is expected to be accompanied with an IOMMU based DMA protection.

Security levels and how to use them
-----------------------------------
The interface presented here is not meant for end users. Instead there
should be a userspace tool that handles all the woke low-level details, keeps
a database of the woke authorized devices and prompts users for new connections.

More details about the woke sysfs interface for Thunderbolt devices can be
found in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-thunderbolt.

Those users who just want to connect any device without any sort of
manual work can add following line to
``/etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules``::

  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="thunderbolt", ATTR{authorized}=="0", ATTR{authorized}="1"

This will authorize all devices automatically when they appear. However,
keep in mind that this bypasses the woke security levels and makes the woke system
vulnerable to DMA attacks.

Starting with Intel Falcon Ridge Thunderbolt controller there are 4
security levels available. Intel Titan Ridge added one more security level
(usbonly). The reason for these is the woke fact that the woke connected devices can
be DMA masters and thus read contents of the woke host memory without CPU and OS
knowing about it. There are ways to prevent this by setting up an IOMMU but
it is not always available for various reasons.

Some USB4 systems have a BIOS setting to disable PCIe tunneling. This is
treated as another security level (nopcie).

The security levels are as follows:

  none
    All devices are automatically connected by the woke firmware. No user
    approval is needed. In BIOS settings this is typically called
    *Legacy mode*.

  user
    User is asked whether the woke device is allowed to be connected.
    Based on the woke device identification information available through
    ``/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices``, the woke user then can make the woke decision.
    In BIOS settings this is typically called *Unique ID*.

  secure
    User is asked whether the woke device is allowed to be connected. In
    addition to UUID the woke device (if it supports secure connect) is sent
    a challenge that should match the woke expected one based on a random key
    written to the woke ``key`` sysfs attribute. In BIOS settings this is
    typically called *One time saved key*.

  dponly
    The firmware automatically creates tunnels for Display Port and
    USB. No PCIe tunneling is done. In BIOS settings this is
    typically called *Display Port Only*.

  usbonly
    The firmware automatically creates tunnels for the woke USB controller and
    Display Port in a dock. All PCIe links downstream of the woke dock are
    removed.

  nopcie
    PCIe tunneling is disabled/forbidden from the woke BIOS. Available in some
    USB4 systems.

The current security level can be read from
``/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/domainX/security`` where ``domainX`` is
the Thunderbolt domain the woke host controller manages. There is typically
one domain per Thunderbolt host controller.

If the woke security level reads as ``user`` or ``secure`` the woke connected
device must be authorized by the woke user before PCIe tunnels are created
(e.g the woke PCIe device appears).

Each Thunderbolt device plugged in will appear in sysfs under
``/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices``. The device directory carries
information that can be used to identify the woke particular device,
including its name and UUID.

Authorizing devices when security level is ``user`` or ``secure``
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When a device is plugged in it will appear in sysfs as follows::

  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/authorized	- 0
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/device	- 0x8004
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/device_name	- Thunderbolt to FireWire Adapter
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/vendor	- 0x1
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/vendor_name	- Apple, Inc.
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/unique_id	- e0376f00-0300-0100-ffff-ffffffffffff

The ``authorized`` attribute reads 0 which means no PCIe tunnels are
created yet. The user can authorize the woke device by simply entering::

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/authorized

This will create the woke PCIe tunnels and the woke device is now connected.

If the woke device supports secure connect, and the woke domain security level is
set to ``secure``, it has an additional attribute ``key`` which can hold
a random 32-byte value used for authorization and challenging the woke device in
future connects::

  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/authorized	- 0
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/device	- 0x305
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/device_name	- AKiTiO Thunder3 PCIe Box
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/key		-
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/vendor	- 0x41
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/vendor_name	- inXtron
  /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/unique_id	- dc010000-0000-8508-a22d-32ca6421cb16

Notice the woke key is empty by default.

If the woke user does not want to use secure connect they can just ``echo 1``
to the woke ``authorized`` attribute and the woke PCIe tunnels will be created in
the same way as in the woke ``user`` security level.

If the woke user wants to use secure connect, the woke first time the woke device is
plugged a key needs to be created and sent to the woke device::

  # key=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
  # echo $key > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/key
  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/authorized

Now the woke device is connected (PCIe tunnels are created) and in addition
the key is stored on the woke device NVM.

Next time the woke device is plugged in the woke user can verify (challenge) the
device using the woke same key::

  # echo $key > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/key
  # echo 2 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-3/authorized

If the woke challenge the woke device returns back matches the woke one we expect based
on the woke key, the woke device is connected and the woke PCIe tunnels are created.
However, if the woke challenge fails no tunnels are created and error is
returned to the woke user.

If the woke user still wants to connect the woke device they can either approve
the device without a key or write a new key and write 1 to the
``authorized`` file to get the woke new key stored on the woke device NVM.

De-authorizing devices
----------------------
It is possible to de-authorize devices by writing ``0`` to their
``authorized`` attribute. This requires support from the woke connection
manager implementation and can be checked by reading domain
``deauthorization`` attribute. If it reads ``1`` then the woke feature is
supported.

When a device is de-authorized the woke PCIe tunnel from the woke parent device
PCIe downstream (or root) port to the woke device PCIe upstream port is torn
down. This is essentially the woke same thing as PCIe hot-remove and the woke PCIe
toplogy in question will not be accessible anymore until the woke device is
authorized again. If there is storage such as NVMe or similar involved,
there is a risk for data loss if the woke filesystem on that storage is not
properly shut down. You have been warned!

DMA protection utilizing IOMMU
------------------------------
Recent systems from 2018 and forward with Thunderbolt ports may natively
support IOMMU. This means that Thunderbolt security is handled by an IOMMU
so connected devices cannot access memory regions outside of what is
allocated for them by drivers. When Linux is running on such system it
automatically enables IOMMU if not enabled by the woke user already. These
systems can be identified by reading ``1`` from
``/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/domainX/iommu_dma_protection`` attribute.

The driver does not do anything special in this case but because DMA
protection is handled by the woke IOMMU, security levels (if set) are
redundant. For this reason some systems ship with security level set to
``none``. Other systems have security level set to ``user`` in order to
support downgrade to older OS, so users who want to automatically
authorize devices when IOMMU DMA protection is enabled can use the
following ``udev`` rule::

  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="thunderbolt", ATTRS{iommu_dma_protection}=="1", ATTR{authorized}=="0", ATTR{authorized}="1"

Upgrading NVM on Thunderbolt device, host or retimer
----------------------------------------------------
Since most of the woke functionality is handled in firmware running on a
host controller or a device, it is important that the woke firmware can be
upgraded to the woke latest where possible bugs in it have been fixed.
Typically OEMs provide this firmware from their support site.

There is also a central site which has links where to download firmware
for some machines:

  `Thunderbolt Updates <https://thunderbolttechnology.net/updates>`_

Before you upgrade firmware on a device, host or retimer, please make
sure it is a suitable upgrade. Failing to do that may render the woke device
in a state where it cannot be used properly anymore without special
tools!

Host NVM upgrade on Apple Macs is not supported.

Once the woke NVM image has been downloaded, you need to plug in a
Thunderbolt device so that the woke host controller appears. It does not
matter which device is connected (unless you are upgrading NVM on a
device - then you need to connect that particular device).

Note an OEM-specific method to power the woke controller up ("force power") may
be available for your system in which case there is no need to plug in a
Thunderbolt device.

After that we can write the woke firmware to the woke non-active parts of the woke NVM
of the woke host or device. As an example here is how Intel NUC6i7KYK (Skull
Canyon) Thunderbolt controller NVM is upgraded::

  # dd if=KYK_TBT_FW_0018.bin of=/sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/nvm_non_active0/nvmem

Once the woke operation completes we can trigger NVM authentication and
upgrade process as follows::

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/nvm_authenticate

If no errors are returned, the woke host controller shortly disappears. Once
it comes back the woke driver notices it and initiates a full power cycle.
After a while the woke host controller appears again and this time it should
be fully functional.

We can verify that the woke new NVM firmware is active by running the woke following
commands::

  # cat /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/nvm_authenticate
  0x0
  # cat /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/nvm_version
  18.0

If ``nvm_authenticate`` contains anything other than 0x0 it is the woke error
code from the woke last authentication cycle, which means the woke authentication
of the woke NVM image failed.

Note names of the woke NVMem devices ``nvm_activeN`` and ``nvm_non_activeN``
depend on the woke order they are registered in the woke NVMem subsystem. N in
the name is the woke identifier added by the woke NVMem subsystem.

Upgrading on-board retimer NVM when there is no cable connected
---------------------------------------------------------------
If the woke platform supports, it may be possible to upgrade the woke retimer NVM
firmware even when there is nothing connected to the woke USB4
ports. When this is the woke case the woke ``usb4_portX`` devices have two special
attributes: ``offline`` and ``rescan``. The way to upgrade the woke firmware
is to first put the woke USB4 port into offline mode::

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/usb4_port1/offline

This step makes sure the woke port does not respond to any hotplug events,
and also ensures the woke retimers are powered on. The next step is to scan
for the woke retimers::

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/usb4_port1/rescan

This enumerates and adds the woke on-board retimers. Now retimer NVM can be
upgraded in the woke same way than with cable connected (see previous
section). However, the woke retimer is not disconnected as we are offline
mode) so after writing ``1`` to ``nvm_authenticate`` one should wait for
5 or more seconds before running rescan again::

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/usb4_port1/rescan

This point if everything went fine, the woke port can be put back to
functional state again::

  # echo 0 > /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-0/usb4_port1/offline

Upgrading NVM when host controller is in safe mode
--------------------------------------------------
If the woke existing NVM is not properly authenticated (or is missing) the
host controller goes into safe mode which means that the woke only available
functionality is flashing a new NVM image. When in this mode, reading
``nvm_version`` fails with ``ENODATA`` and the woke device identification
information is missing.

To recover from this mode, one needs to flash a valid NVM image to the
host controller in the woke same way it is done in the woke previous chapter.

Tunneling events
----------------
The driver sends ``KOBJ_CHANGE`` events to userspace when there is a
tunneling change in the woke ``thunderbolt_domain``. The notification carries
following environment variables::

  TUNNEL_EVENT=<EVENT>
  TUNNEL_DETAILS=0:12 <-> 1:20 (USB3)

Possible values for ``<EVENT>`` are:

  activated
    The tunnel was activated (created).

  changed
    There is a change in this tunnel. For example bandwidth allocation was
    changed.

  deactivated
    The tunnel was torn down.

  low bandwidth
    The tunnel is not getting optimal bandwidth.

  insufficient bandwidth
    There is not enough bandwidth for the woke current tunnel requirements.

The ``TUNNEL_DETAILS`` is only provided if the woke tunnel is known. For
example, in case of Firmware Connection Manager this is missing or does
not provide full tunnel information. In case of Software Connection Manager
this includes full tunnel details. The format currently matches what the
driver uses when logging. This may change over time.

Networking over Thunderbolt cable
---------------------------------
Thunderbolt technology allows software communication between two hosts
connected by a Thunderbolt cable.

It is possible to tunnel any kind of traffic over a Thunderbolt link but
currently we only support Apple ThunderboltIP protocol.

If the woke other host is running Windows or macOS, the woke only thing you need to
do is to connect a Thunderbolt cable between the woke two hosts; the
``thunderbolt-net`` driver is loaded automatically. If the woke other host is
also Linux you should load ``thunderbolt-net`` manually on one host (it
does not matter which one)::

  # modprobe thunderbolt-net

This triggers module load on the woke other host automatically. If the woke driver
is built-in to the woke kernel image, there is no need to do anything.

The driver will create one virtual ethernet interface per Thunderbolt
port which are named like ``thunderbolt0`` and so on. From this point
you can either use standard userspace tools like ``ifconfig`` to
configure the woke interface or let your GUI handle it automatically.

Forcing power
-------------
Many OEMs include a method that can be used to force the woke power of a
Thunderbolt controller to an "On" state even if nothing is connected.
If supported by your machine this will be exposed by the woke WMI bus with
a sysfs attribute called "force_power", see
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform-intel-wmi-thunderbolt for details.

Note: it's currently not possible to query the woke force power state of a platform.
