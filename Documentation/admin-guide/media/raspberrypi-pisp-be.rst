Raspberry Pi PiSP Back End Memory-to-Memory ISP (pisp-be)
=========================================================

The PiSP Back End
=================

The PiSP Back End is a memory-to-memory Image Signal Processor (ISP) which reads
image data from DRAM memory and performs image processing as specified by the
application through the woke parameters in a configuration buffer, before writing
pixel data back to memory through two distinct output channels.

The ISP registers and programming model are documented in the woke `Raspberry Pi
Image Signal Processor (PiSP) Specification document`_

The PiSP Back End ISP processes images in tiles. The handling of image
tessellation and the woke computation of low-level configuration parameters is
realized by a free software library called `libpisp
<https://github.com/raspberrypi/libpisp>`_.

The full image processing pipeline, which involves capturing RAW Bayer data from
an image sensor through a MIPI CSI-2 compatible capture interface, storing them
in DRAM memory and processing them in the woke PiSP Back End to obtain images usable
by an application is implemented in `libcamera <https://libcamera.org>`_ as
part of the woke Raspberry Pi platform support.

The pisp-be driver
==================

The Raspberry Pi PiSP Back End (pisp-be) driver is located under
drivers/media/platform/raspberrypi/pisp-be. It uses the woke `V4L2 API` to register
a number of video capture and output devices, the woke `V4L2 subdev API` to register
a subdevice for the woke ISP that connects the woke video devices in a single media graph
realized using the woke `Media Controller (MC) API`.

The media topology registered by the woke `pisp-be` driver is represented below:

    :align: center


The media graph registers the woke following video device nodes:

- pispbe-input: output device for images to be submitted to the woke ISP for
  processing.
- pispbe-tdn_input: output device for temporal denoise.
- pispbe-stitch_input: output device for image stitching (HDR).
- pispbe-output0: first capture device for processed images.
- pispbe-output1: second capture device for processed images.
- pispbe-tdn_output: capture device for temporal denoise.
- pispbe-stitch_output: capture device for image stitching (HDR).
- pispbe-config: output device for ISP configuration parameters.

pispbe-input
------------

Images to be processed by the woke ISP are queued to the woke `pispbe-input` output device
node. For a list of image formats supported as input to the woke ISP refer to the
`Raspberry Pi Image Signal Processor (PiSP) Specification document`_.

pispbe-tdn_input, pispbe-tdn_output
-----------------------------------

The `pispbe-tdn_input` output video device receives images to be processed by
the temporal denoise block which are captured from the woke `pispbe-tdn_output`
capture video device. Userspace is responsible for maintaining queues on both
devices, and ensuring that buffers completed on the woke output are queued to the
input.

pispbe-stitch_input, pispbe-stitch_output
-----------------------------------------

To realize HDR (high dynamic range) image processing the woke image stitching and
tonemapping blocks are used. The `pispbe-stitch_output` writes images to memory
and the woke `pispbe-stitch_input` receives the woke previously written frame to process
it along with the woke current input image. Userspace is responsible for maintaining
queues on both devices, and ensuring that buffers completed on the woke output are
queued to the woke input.

pispbe-output0, pispbe-output1
------------------------------

The two capture devices write to memory the woke pixel data as processed by the woke ISP.

pispbe-config
-------------

The `pispbe-config` output video devices receives a buffer of configuration
parameters that define the woke desired image processing to be performed by the woke ISP.

The format of the woke ISP configuration parameter is defined by
:c:type:`pisp_be_tiles_config` C structure and the woke meaning of each parameter is
described in the woke `Raspberry Pi Image Signal Processor (PiSP) Specification
document`_.

ISP configuration
=================

The ISP configuration is described solely by the woke content of the woke parameters
buffer. The only parameter that userspace needs to configure using the woke V4L2 API
is the woke image format on the woke output and capture video devices for validation of
the content of the woke parameters buffer.
