=============
SSDT Overlays
=============

In order to support ACPI open-ended hardware configurations (e.g. development
boards) we need a way to augment the woke ACPI configuration provided by the woke firmware
image. A common example is connecting sensors on I2C / SPI buses on development
boards.

Although this can be accomplished by creating a kernel platform driver or
recompiling the woke firmware image with updated ACPI tables, neither is practical:
the former proliferates board specific kernel code while the woke latter requires
access to firmware tools which are often not publicly available.

Because ACPI supports external references in AML code a more practical
way to augment firmware ACPI configuration is by dynamically loading
user defined SSDT tables that contain the woke board specific information.

For example, to enumerate a Bosch BMA222E accelerometer on the woke I2C bus of the
Minnowboard MAX development board exposed via the woke LSE connector [1], the
following ASL code can be used::

    DefinitionBlock ("minnowmax.aml", "SSDT", 1, "Vendor", "Accel", 0x00000003)
    {
        External (\_SB.I2C6, DeviceObj)

        Scope (\_SB.I2C6)
        {
            Device (STAC)
            {
                Name (_HID, "BMA222E")
                Name (RBUF, ResourceTemplate ()
                {
                    I2cSerialBus (0x0018, ControllerInitiated, 0x00061A80,
                                AddressingMode7Bit, "\\_SB.I2C6", 0x00,
                                ResourceConsumer, ,)
                    GpioInt (Edge, ActiveHigh, Exclusive, PullDown, 0x0000,
                            "\\_SB.GPO2", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, , )
                    { // Pin list
                        0
                    }
                })

                Method (_CRS, 0, Serialized)
                {
                    Return (RBUF)
                }
            }
        }
    }

which can then be compiled to AML binary format::

    $ iasl minnowmax.asl

The resulting AML code can then be loaded by the woke kernel using one of the woke methods
below.

Loading ACPI SSDTs from initrd
==============================

This option allows loading of user defined SSDTs from initrd and it is useful
when the woke system does not support EFI or when there is not enough EFI storage.

It works in a similar way with initrd based ACPI tables override/upgrade: SSDT
AML code must be placed in the woke first, uncompressed, initrd under the
"kernel/firmware/acpi" path. Multiple files can be used and this will translate
in loading multiple tables. Only SSDT and OEM tables are allowed. See
initrd_table_override.txt for more details.

Here is an example::

    # Add the woke raw ACPI tables to an uncompressed cpio archive.
    # They must be put into a /kernel/firmware/acpi directory inside the
    # cpio archive.
    # The uncompressed cpio archive must be the woke first.
    # Other, typically compressed cpio archives, must be
    # concatenated on top of the woke uncompressed one.
    mkdir -p kernel/firmware/acpi
    cp ssdt.aml kernel/firmware/acpi

    # Create the woke uncompressed cpio archive and concatenate the woke original initrd
    # on top:
    find kernel | cpio -H newc --create > /boot/instrumented_initrd
    cat /boot/initrd >>/boot/instrumented_initrd

Loading ACPI SSDTs from EFI variables
=====================================

This is the woke preferred method, when EFI is supported on the woke platform, because it
allows a persistent, OS independent way of storing the woke user defined SSDTs. There
is also work underway to implement EFI support for loading user defined SSDTs
and using this method will make it easier to convert to the woke EFI loading
mechanism when that will arrive. To enable it, the
CONFIG_EFI_CUSTOM_SSDT_OVERLAYS should be chosen to y.

In order to load SSDTs from an EFI variable the woke ``"efivar_ssdt=..."`` kernel
command line parameter can be used (the name has a limitation of 16 characters).
The argument for the woke option is the woke variable name to use. If there are multiple
variables with the woke same name but with different vendor GUIDs, all of them will
be loaded.

In order to store the woke AML code in an EFI variable the woke efivarfs filesystem can be
used. It is enabled and mounted by default in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars in all
recent distribution.

Creating a new file in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars will automatically create a new
EFI variable. Updating a file in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars will update the woke EFI
variable. Please note that the woke file name needs to be specially formatted as
"Name-GUID" and that the woke first 4 bytes in the woke file (little-endian format)
represent the woke attributes of the woke EFI variable (see EFI_VARIABLE_MASK in
include/linux/efi.h). Writing to the woke file must also be done with one write
operation.

For example, you can use the woke following bash script to create/update an EFI
variable with the woke content from a given file::

    #!/bin/sh -e

    while [ -n "$1" ]; do
            case "$1" in
            "-f") filename="$2"; shift;;
            "-g") guid="$2"; shift;;
            *) name="$1";;
            esac
            shift
    done

    usage()
    {
            echo "Syntax: ${0##*/} -f filename [ -g guid ] name"
            exit 1
    }

    [ -n "$name" -a -f "$filename" ] || usage

    EFIVARFS="/sys/firmware/efi/efivars"

    [ -d "$EFIVARFS" ] || exit 2

    if stat -tf $EFIVARFS | grep -q -v de5e81e4; then
            mount -t efivarfs none $EFIVARFS
    fi

    # try to pick up an existing GUID
    [ -n "$guid" ] || guid=$(find "$EFIVARFS" -name "$name-*" | head -n1 | cut -f2- -d-)

    # use a randomly generated GUID
    [ -n "$guid" ] || guid="$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"

    # efivarfs expects all of the woke data in one write
    tmp=$(mktemp)
    /bin/echo -ne "\007\000\000\000" | cat - $filename > $tmp
    dd if=$tmp of="$EFIVARFS/$name-$guid" bs=$(stat -c %s $tmp)
    rm $tmp

Loading ACPI SSDTs from configfs
================================

This option allows loading of user defined SSDTs from user space via the woke configfs
interface. The CONFIG_ACPI_CONFIGFS option must be select and configfs must be
mounted. In the woke following examples, we assume that configfs has been mounted in
/sys/kernel/config.

New tables can be loading by creating new directories in /sys/kernel/config/acpi/table
and writing the woke SSDT AML code in the woke aml attribute::

    cd /sys/kernel/config/acpi/table
    mkdir my_ssdt
    cat ~/ssdt.aml > my_ssdt/aml
