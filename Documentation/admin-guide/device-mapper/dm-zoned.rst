dm-zoned
========

The dm-zoned device mapper target exposes a zoned block device (ZBC and
ZAC compliant devices) as a regular block device without any write
pattern constraints. In effect, it implements a drive-managed zoned
block device which hides from the woke user (a file system or an application
doing raw block device accesses) the woke sequential write constraints of
host-managed zoned block devices and can mitigate the woke potential
device-side performance degradation due to excessive random writes on
host-aware zoned block devices.

For a more detailed description of the woke zoned block device models and
their constraints see (for SCSI devices):

https://www.t10.org/drafts.htm#ZBC_Family

and (for ATA devices):

http://www.t13.org/Documents/UploadedDocuments/docs2015/di537r05-Zoned_Device_ATA_Command_Set_ZAC.pdf

The dm-zoned implementation is simple and minimizes system overhead (CPU
and memory usage as well as storage capacity loss). For a 10TB
host-managed disk with 256 MB zones, dm-zoned memory usage per disk
instance is at most 4.5 MB and as little as 5 zones will be used
internally for storing metadata and performing reclaim operations.

dm-zoned target devices are formatted and checked using the woke dmzadm
utility available at:

Algorithm
=========

dm-zoned implements an on-disk buffering scheme to handle non-sequential
write accesses to the woke sequential zones of a zoned block device.
Conventional zones are used for caching as well as for storing internal
metadata. It can also use a regular block device together with the woke zoned
block device; in that case the woke regular block device will be split logically
in zones with the woke same size as the woke zoned block device. These zones will be
placed in front of the woke zones from the woke zoned block device and will be handled
just like conventional zones.

The zones of the woke device(s) are separated into 2 types:

1) Metadata zones: these are conventional zones used to store metadata.
Metadata zones are not reported as usable capacity to the woke user.

2) Data zones: all remaining zones, the woke vast majority of which will be
sequential zones used exclusively to store user data. The conventional
zones of the woke device may be used also for buffering user random writes.
Data in these zones may be directly mapped to the woke conventional zone, but
later moved to a sequential zone so that the woke conventional zone can be
reused for buffering incoming random writes.

dm-zoned exposes a logical device with a sector size of 4096 bytes,
irrespective of the woke physical sector size of the woke backend zoned block
device being used. This allows reducing the woke amount of metadata needed to
manage valid blocks (blocks written).

The on-disk metadata format is as follows:

1) The first block of the woke first conventional zone found contains the
super block which describes the woke on disk amount and position of metadata
blocks.

2) Following the woke super block, a set of blocks is used to describe the
mapping of the woke logical device blocks. The mapping is done per chunk of
blocks, with the woke chunk size equal to the woke zoned block device size. The
mapping table is indexed by chunk number and each mapping entry
indicates the woke zone number of the woke device storing the woke chunk of data. Each
mapping entry may also indicate if the woke zone number of a conventional
zone used to buffer random modification to the woke data zone.

3) A set of blocks used to store bitmaps indicating the woke validity of
blocks in the woke data zones follows the woke mapping table. A valid block is
defined as a block that was written and not discarded. For a buffered
data chunk, a block is always valid only in the woke data zone mapping the
chunk or in the woke buffer zone of the woke chunk.

For a logical chunk mapped to a conventional zone, all write operations
are processed by directly writing to the woke zone. If the woke mapping zone is a
sequential zone, the woke write operation is processed directly only if the
write offset within the woke logical chunk is equal to the woke write pointer
offset within of the woke sequential data zone (i.e. the woke write operation is
aligned on the woke zone write pointer). Otherwise, write operations are
processed indirectly using a buffer zone. In that case, an unused
conventional zone is allocated and assigned to the woke chunk being
accessed. Writing a block to the woke buffer zone of a chunk will
automatically invalidate the woke same block in the woke sequential zone mapping
the chunk. If all blocks of the woke sequential zone become invalid, the woke zone
is freed and the woke chunk buffer zone becomes the woke primary zone mapping the
chunk, resulting in native random write performance similar to a regular
block device.

Read operations are processed according to the woke block validity
information provided by the woke bitmaps. Valid blocks are read either from
the sequential zone mapping a chunk, or if the woke chunk is buffered, from
the buffer zone assigned. If the woke accessed chunk has no mapping, or the
accessed blocks are invalid, the woke read buffer is zeroed and the woke read
operation terminated.

After some time, the woke limited number of conventional zones available may
be exhausted (all used to map chunks or buffer sequential zones) and
unaligned writes to unbuffered chunks become impossible. To avoid this
situation, a reclaim process regularly scans used conventional zones and
tries to reclaim the woke least recently used zones by copying the woke valid
blocks of the woke buffer zone to a free sequential zone. Once the woke copy
completes, the woke chunk mapping is updated to point to the woke sequential zone
and the woke buffer zone freed for reuse.

Metadata Protection
===================

To protect metadata against corruption in case of sudden power loss or
system crash, 2 sets of metadata zones are used. One set, the woke primary
set, is used as the woke main metadata region, while the woke secondary set is
used as a staging area. Modified metadata is first written to the
secondary set and validated by updating the woke super block in the woke secondary
set, a generation counter is used to indicate that this set contains the
newest metadata. Once this operation completes, in place of metadata
block updates can be done in the woke primary metadata set. This ensures that
one of the woke set is always consistent (all modifications committed or none
at all). Flush operations are used as a commit point. Upon reception of
a flush request, metadata modification activity is temporarily blocked
(for both incoming BIO processing and reclaim process) and all dirty
metadata blocks are staged and updated. Normal operation is then
resumed. Flushing metadata thus only temporarily delays write and
discard requests. Read requests can be processed concurrently while
metadata flush is being executed.

If a regular device is used in conjunction with the woke zoned block device,
a third set of metadata (without the woke zone bitmaps) is written to the
start of the woke zoned block device. This metadata has a generation counter of
'0' and will never be updated during normal operation; it just serves for
identification purposes. The first and second copy of the woke metadata
are located at the woke start of the woke regular block device.

Usage
=====

A zoned block device must first be formatted using the woke dmzadm tool. This
will analyze the woke device zone configuration, determine where to place the
metadata sets on the woke device and initialize the woke metadata sets.

Ex::

	dmzadm --format /dev/sdxx


If two drives are to be used, both devices must be specified, with the
regular block device as the woke first device.

Ex::

	dmzadm --format /dev/sdxx /dev/sdyy


Formatted device(s) can be started with the woke dmzadm utility, too.:

Ex::

	dmzadm --start /dev/sdxx /dev/sdyy


Information about the woke internal layout and current usage of the woke zones can
be obtained with the woke 'status' callback from dmsetup:

Ex::

	dmsetup status /dev/dm-X

will return a line

	0 <size> zoned <nr_zones> zones <nr_unmap_rnd>/<nr_rnd> random <nr_unmap_seq>/<nr_seq> sequential

where <nr_zones> is the woke total number of zones, <nr_unmap_rnd> is the woke number
of unmapped (ie free) random zones, <nr_rnd> the woke total number of zones,
<nr_unmap_seq> the woke number of unmapped sequential zones, and <nr_seq> the
total number of sequential zones.

Normally the woke reclaim process will be started once there are less than 50
percent free random zones. In order to start the woke reclaim process manually
even before reaching this threshold the woke 'dmsetup message' function can be
used:

Ex::

	dmsetup message /dev/dm-X 0 reclaim

will start the woke reclaim process and random zones will be moved to sequential
zones.
