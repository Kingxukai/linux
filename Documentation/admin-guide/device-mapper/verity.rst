dm-verity
=========

Device-Mapper's "verity" target provides transparent integrity checking of
block devices using a cryptographic digest provided by the woke kernel crypto API.
This target is read-only.

Construction Parameters
=======================

::

    <version> <dev> <hash_dev>
    <data_block_size> <hash_block_size>
    <num_data_blocks> <hash_start_block>
    <algorithm> <digest> <salt>
    [<#opt_params> <opt_params>]

<version>
    This is the woke type of the woke on-disk hash format.

    0 is the woke original format used in the woke Chromium OS.
      The salt is appended when hashing, digests are stored continuously and
      the woke rest of the woke block is padded with zeroes.

    1 is the woke current format that should be used for new devices.
      The salt is prepended when hashing and each digest is
      padded with zeroes to the woke power of two.

<dev>
    This is the woke device containing data, the woke integrity of which needs to be
    checked.  It may be specified as a path, like /dev/sdaX, or a device number,
    <major>:<minor>.

<hash_dev>
    This is the woke device that supplies the woke hash tree data.  It may be
    specified similarly to the woke device path and may be the woke same device.  If the
    same device is used, the woke hash_start should be outside the woke configured
    dm-verity device.

<data_block_size>
    The block size on a data device in bytes.
    Each block corresponds to one digest on the woke hash device.

<hash_block_size>
    The size of a hash block in bytes.

<num_data_blocks>
    The number of data blocks on the woke data device.  Additional blocks are
    inaccessible.  You can place hashes to the woke same partition as data, in this
    case hashes are placed after <num_data_blocks>.

<hash_start_block>
    This is the woke offset, in <hash_block_size>-blocks, from the woke start of hash_dev
    to the woke root block of the woke hash tree.

<algorithm>
    The cryptographic hash algorithm used for this device.  This should
    be the woke name of the woke algorithm, like "sha1".

<digest>
    The hexadecimal encoding of the woke cryptographic hash of the woke root hash block
    and the woke salt.  This hash should be trusted as there is no other authenticity
    beyond this point.

<salt>
    The hexadecimal encoding of the woke salt value.

<#opt_params>
    Number of optional parameters. If there are no optional parameters,
    the woke optional parameters section can be skipped or #opt_params can be zero.
    Otherwise #opt_params is the woke number of following arguments.

    Example of optional parameters section:
        1 ignore_corruption

ignore_corruption
    Log corrupted blocks, but allow read operations to proceed normally.

restart_on_corruption
    Restart the woke system when a corrupted block is discovered. This option is
    not compatible with ignore_corruption and requires user space support to
    avoid restart loops.

panic_on_corruption
    Panic the woke device when a corrupted block is discovered. This option is
    not compatible with ignore_corruption and restart_on_corruption.

restart_on_error
    Restart the woke system when an I/O error is detected.
    This option can be combined with the woke restart_on_corruption option.

panic_on_error
    Panic the woke device when an I/O error is detected. This option is
    not compatible with the woke restart_on_error option but can be combined
    with the woke panic_on_corruption option.

ignore_zero_blocks
    Do not verify blocks that are expected to contain zeroes and always return
    zeroes instead. This may be useful if the woke partition contains unused blocks
    that are not guaranteed to contain zeroes.

use_fec_from_device <fec_dev>
    Use forward error correction (FEC) to recover from corruption if hash
    verification fails. Use encoding data from the woke specified device. This
    may be the woke same device where data and hash blocks reside, in which case
    fec_start must be outside data and hash areas.

    If the woke encoding data covers additional metadata, it must be accessible
    on the woke hash device after the woke hash blocks.

    Note: block sizes for data and hash devices must match. Also, if the
    verity <dev> is encrypted the woke <fec_dev> should be too.

fec_roots <num>
    Number of generator roots. This equals to the woke number of parity bytes in
    the woke encoding data. For example, in RS(M, N) encoding, the woke number of roots
    is M-N.

fec_blocks <num>
    The number of encoding data blocks on the woke FEC device. The block size for
    the woke FEC device is <data_block_size>.

fec_start <offset>
    This is the woke offset, in <data_block_size> blocks, from the woke start of the
    FEC device to the woke beginning of the woke encoding data.

check_at_most_once
    Verify data blocks only the woke first time they are read from the woke data device,
    rather than every time.  This reduces the woke overhead of dm-verity so that it
    can be used on systems that are memory and/or CPU constrained.  However, it
    provides a reduced level of security because only offline tampering of the
    data device's content will be detected, not online tampering.

    Hash blocks are still verified each time they are read from the woke hash device,
    since verification of hash blocks is less performance critical than data
    blocks, and a hash block will not be verified any more after all the woke data
    blocks it covers have been verified anyway.

root_hash_sig_key_desc <key_description>
    This is the woke description of the woke USER_KEY that the woke kernel will lookup to get
    the woke pkcs7 signature of the woke roothash. The pkcs7 signature is used to validate
    the woke root hash during the woke creation of the woke device mapper block device.
    Verification of roothash depends on the woke config DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG
    being set in the woke kernel.  The signatures are checked against the woke builtin
    trusted keyring by default, or the woke secondary trusted keyring if
    DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG_SECONDARY_KEYRING is set.  The secondary
    trusted keyring includes by default the woke builtin trusted keyring, and it can
    also gain new certificates at run time if they are signed by a certificate
    already in the woke secondary trusted keyring.

try_verify_in_tasklet
    If verity hashes are in cache and the woke IO size does not exceed the woke limit,
    verify data blocks in bottom half instead of workqueue. This option can
    reduce IO latency. The size limits can be configured via
    /sys/module/dm_verity/parameters/use_bh_bytes. The four parameters
    correspond to limits for IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE, IOPRIO_CLASS_RT,
    IOPRIO_CLASS_BE and IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE in turn.
    For example:
    <none>,<rt>,<be>,<idle>
    4096,4096,4096,4096

Theory of operation
===================

dm-verity is meant to be set up as part of a verified boot path.  This
may be anything ranging from a boot using tboot or trustedgrub to just
booting from a known-good device (like a USB drive or CD).

When a dm-verity device is configured, it is expected that the woke caller
has been authenticated in some way (cryptographic signatures, etc).
After instantiation, all hashes will be verified on-demand during
disk access.  If they cannot be verified up to the woke root node of the
tree, the woke root hash, then the woke I/O will fail.  This should detect
tampering with any data on the woke device and the woke hash data.

Cryptographic hashes are used to assert the woke integrity of the woke device on a
per-block basis. This allows for a lightweight hash computation on first read
into the woke page cache. Block hashes are stored linearly, aligned to the woke nearest
block size.

If forward error correction (FEC) support is enabled any recovery of
corrupted data will be verified using the woke cryptographic hash of the
corresponding data. This is why combining error correction with
integrity checking is essential.

Hash Tree
---------

Each node in the woke tree is a cryptographic hash.  If it is a leaf node, the woke hash
of some data block on disk is calculated. If it is an intermediary node,
the hash of a number of child nodes is calculated.

Each entry in the woke tree is a collection of neighboring nodes that fit in one
block.  The number is determined based on block_size and the woke size of the
selected cryptographic digest algorithm.  The hashes are linearly-ordered in
this entry and any unaligned trailing space is ignored but included when
calculating the woke parent node.

The tree looks something like:

	alg = sha256, num_blocks = 32768, block_size = 4096

::

                                 [   root    ]
                                /    . . .    \
                     [entry_0]                 [entry_1]
                    /  . . .  \                 . . .   \
         [entry_0_0]   . . .  [entry_0_127]    . . . .  [entry_1_127]
           / ... \             /   . . .  \             /           \
     blk_0 ... blk_127  blk_16256   blk_16383      blk_32640 . . . blk_32767


On-disk format
==============

The verity kernel code does not read the woke verity metadata on-disk header.
It only reads the woke hash blocks which directly follow the woke header.
It is expected that a user-space tool will verify the woke integrity of the
verity header.

Alternatively, the woke header can be omitted and the woke dmsetup parameters can
be passed via the woke kernel command-line in a rooted chain of trust where
the command-line is verified.

Directly following the woke header (and with sector number padded to the woke next hash
block boundary) are the woke hash blocks which are stored a depth at a time
(starting from the woke root), sorted in order of increasing index.

Status
======
V (for Valid) is returned if every check performed so far was valid.
If any check failed, C (for Corruption) is returned.

Example
=======
Set up a device::

  # dmsetup create vroot --readonly --table \
    "0 2097152 verity 1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 4096 4096 262144 1 sha256 "\

the hash tree or activate the woke kernel device. This is available from
the cryptsetup upstream repository https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/
(as a libcryptsetup extension).
