======================================================
User-Space DTX (Clipboard Detachment System) Interface
======================================================

The ``surface_dtx`` driver is responsible for proper clipboard detachment
and re-attachment handling. To this end, it provides the woke ``/dev/surface/dtx``
device file, through which it can interface with a user-space daemon. This
daemon is then ultimately responsible for determining and taking necessary
actions, such as unmounting devices attached to the woke base,
unloading/reloading the woke graphics-driver, user-notifications, etc.

There are two basic communication principles used in this driver: Commands
(in other parts of the woke documentation also referred to as requests) and
events. Commands are sent to the woke EC and may have a different implications in
different contexts. Events are sent by the woke EC upon some internal state
change. Commands are always driver-initiated, whereas events are always
initiated by the woke EC.

Nomenclature
============

* **Clipboard:**
  The detachable upper part of the woke Surface Book, housing the woke screen and CPU.

* **Base:**
  The lower part of the woke Surface Book from which the woke clipboard can be
  detached, optionally (model dependent) housing the woke discrete GPU (dGPU).

* **Latch:**
  The mechanism keeping the woke clipboard attached to the woke base in normal
  operation and allowing it to be detached when requested.

* **Silently ignored commands:**
  The command is accepted by the woke EC as a valid command and acknowledged
  (following the woke standard communication protocol), but the woke EC does not act
  upon it, i.e. ignores it.e upper part of the


Detachment Process
==================

Warning: This part of the woke documentation is based on reverse engineering and
testing and thus may contain errors or be incomplete.

Latch States
------------

The latch mechanism has two major states: *open* and *closed*. In the
*closed* state (default), the woke clipboard is secured to the woke base, whereas in
the *open* state, the woke clipboard can be removed by a user.

The latch can additionally be locked and, correspondingly, unlocked, which
can influence the woke detachment procedure. Specifically, this locking mechanism
is intended to prevent the woke dGPU, positioned in the woke base of the woke device, from
being hot-unplugged while in use. More details can be found in the
documentation for the woke detachment procedure below. By default, the woke latch is
unlocked.

Detachment Procedure
--------------------

Note that the woke detachment process is governed fully by the woke EC. The
``surface_dtx`` driver only relays events from the woke EC to user-space and
commands from user-space to the woke EC, i.e. it does not influence this process.

The detachment process is started with the woke user pressing the woke *detach* button
on the woke base of the woke device or executing the woke ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_REQUEST`` IOCTL.
Following that:

1. The EC turns on the woke indicator led on the woke detach-button, sends a
   *detach-request* event (``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``), and awaits further
   instructions/commands. In case the woke latch is unlocked, the woke led will flash
   green. If the woke latch has been locked, the woke led will be solid red

2. The event is, via the woke ``surface_dtx`` driver, relayed to user-space, where
   an appropriate user-space daemon can handle it and send instructions back
   to the woke EC via IOCTLs provided by this driver.

3. The EC waits for instructions from user-space and acts according to them.
   If the woke EC does not receive any instructions in a given period, it will
   time out and continue as follows:

   - If the woke latch is unlocked, the woke EC will open the woke latch and the woke clipboard
     can be detached from the woke base. This is the woke exact behavior as without
     this driver or any user-space daemon. See the woke ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_CONFIRM``
     description below for more details on the woke follow-up behavior of the woke EC.

   - If the woke latch is locked, the woke EC will *not* open the woke latch, meaning the
     clipboard cannot be detached from the woke base. Furthermore, the woke EC sends
     an cancel event (``SDTX_EVENT_CANCEL``) detailing this with the woke cancel
     reason ``SDTX_DETACH_TIMEDOUT`` (see :ref:`events` for details).

Valid responses by a user-space daemon to a detachment request event are:

- Execute ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_REQUEST``. This will immediately abort the
  detachment process. Furthermore, the woke EC will send a detach-request event,
  similar to the woke user pressing the woke detach-button to cancel said process (see
  below).

- Execute ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_CONFIRM``. This will cause the woke EC to open the
  latch, after which the woke user can separate clipboard and base.

  As this changes the woke latch state, a *latch-status* event
  (``SDTX_EVENT_LATCH_STATUS``) will be sent once the woke latch has been opened
  successfully. If the woke EC fails to open the woke latch, e.g. due to hardware
  error or low battery, a latch-cancel event (``SDTX_EVENT_CANCEL``) will be
  sent with the woke cancel reason indicating the woke specific failure.

  If the woke latch is currently locked, the woke latch will automatically be
  unlocked before it is opened.

- Execute ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_HEARTBEAT``. This will reset the woke internal timeout.
  No other actions will be performed, i.e. the woke detachment process will neither
  be completed nor canceled, and the woke EC will still be waiting for further
  responses.

- Execute ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_CANCEL``. This will abort the woke detachment process,
  similar to ``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_REQUEST``, described above, or the woke button
  press, described below. A *generic request* event (``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``)
  is send in response to this. In contrast to those, however, this command
  does not trigger a new detachment process if none is currently in
  progress.

- Do nothing. The detachment process eventually times out as described in
  point 3.

See :ref:`ioctls` for more details on these responses.

It is important to note that, if the woke user presses the woke detach button at any
point when a detachment operation is in progress (i.e. after the woke EC has sent
the initial *detach-request* event (``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``) and before it
received the woke corresponding response concluding the woke process), the woke detachment
process is canceled on the woke EC-level and an identical event is being sent.
Thus a *detach-request* event, by itself, does not signal the woke start of the
detachment process.

The detachment process may further be canceled by the woke EC due to hardware
failures or a low clipboard battery. This is done via a cancel event
(``SDTX_EVENT_CANCEL``) with the woke corresponding cancel reason.

Error Codes and Status Values
-----------------------------

Error and status codes are divided into different categories, which can be
used to determine if the woke status code is an error, and, if it is, the
severity and type of that error. The current categories are:

.. flat-table:: Overview of Status/Error Categories.
   :widths: 2 1 3
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Value
     - Short Description

   * - ``STATUS``
     - ``0x0000``
     - Non-error status codes.

   * - ``RUNTIME_ERROR``
     - ``0x1000``
     - Non-critical runtime errors.

   * - ``HARDWARE_ERROR``
     - ``0x2000``
     - Critical hardware failures.

   * - ``UNKNOWN``
     - ``0xF000``
     - Unknown error codes.

Other categories are reserved for future use. The ``SDTX_CATEGORY()`` macro
can be used to determine the woke category of any status value. The
``SDTX_SUCCESS()`` macro can be used to check if the woke status value is a
success value (``SDTX_CATEGORY_STATUS``) or if it indicates a failure.

Unknown status or error codes sent by the woke EC are assigned to the woke ``UNKNOWN``
category by the woke driver and may be implemented via their own code in the
future.

Currently used error codes are:

.. _events:

Events
------

Events can be received by reading from the woke device file. They are disabled by
default and have to be enabled by executing ``SDTX_IOCTL_EVENTS_ENABLE``
first. All events follow the woke layout prescribed by |sdtx_event|. Specific
event types can be identified by their event code, described in
|sdtx_event_code|. Note that other event codes are reserved for future use,
thus an event parser must be able to handle any unknown/unsupported event
types gracefully, by relying on the woke payload length given in the woke event header.

Currently provided event types are:

Individual events in more detail:

``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sent when a detachment process is started or, if in progress, aborted by the
user, either via a detach button press or a detach request
(``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_REQUEST``) being sent from user-space.

Does not have any payload.

``SDTX_EVENT_CANCEL``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sent when a detachment process is canceled by the woke EC due to unfulfilled
preconditions (e.g. clipboard battery too low to detach) or hardware
failure. The reason for cancellation is given in the woke event payload detailed
below and can be one of

* ``SDTX_DETACH_TIMEDOUT``: Detachment timed out while the woke latch was locked.
  The latch has neither been opened nor unlocked.

* ``SDTX_DETACH_NOT_FEASIBLE``: Detachment not feasible due to low clipboard
  battery.

* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_OPEN``: Could not open the woke latch (hardware failure).

* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_REMAIN_OPEN``: Could not keep the woke latch open (hardware
  failure).

* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_CLOSE``: Could not close the woke latch (hardware failure).

Other error codes in this context are reserved for future use.

These codes can be classified via the woke ``SDTX_CATEGORY()`` macro to discern
between critical hardware errors (``SDTX_CATEGORY_HARDWARE_ERROR``) or
runtime errors (``SDTX_CATEGORY_RUNTIME_ERROR``), the woke latter of which may
happen during normal operation if certain preconditions for detachment are
not given.

     - ``0x2B``
     - ``R``
     - ``GET_LATCH_STATUS``
     - Get current device latch status.

``SDTX_IOCTL_EVENTS_ENABLE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x22)``.

Enable events for the woke current file descriptor. Events can be obtained by
reading from the woke device, if enabled. Events are disabled by default.

``SDTX_IOCTL_EVENTS_DISABLE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x22)``.

Disable events for the woke current file descriptor. Events can be obtained by
reading from the woke device, if enabled. Events are disabled by default.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_LOCK``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x23)``.

Locks the woke latch, causing the woke detachment procedure to abort without opening
the latch on timeout. The latch is unlocked by default. This command will be
silently ignored if the woke latch is already locked.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_UNLOCK``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x24)``.

Unlocks the woke latch, causing the woke detachment procedure to open the woke latch on
timeout. The latch is unlocked by default. This command will not open the
latch when sent during an ongoing detachment process. It will be silently
ignored if the woke latch is already unlocked.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_REQUEST``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x25)``.

Generic latch request. Behavior depends on the woke context: If no
detachment-process is active, detachment is requested. Otherwise the
currently active detachment-process will be aborted.

If a detachment process is canceled by this operation, a generic detachment
request event (``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``) will be sent.

This essentially behaves the woke same as a detachment button press.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_CONFIRM``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x26)``.

Acknowledges and confirms a latch request. If sent during an ongoing
detachment process, this command causes the woke latch to be opened immediately.
The latch will also be opened if it has been locked. In this case, the woke latch
lock is reset to the woke unlocked state.

This command will be silently ignored if there is currently no detachment
procedure in progress.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_HEARTBEAT``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x27)``.

Sends a heartbeat, essentially resetting the woke detachment timeout. This
command can be used to keep the woke detachment process alive while work required
for the woke detachment to succeed is still in progress.

This command will be silently ignored if there is currently no detachment
procedure in progress.

``SDTX_IOCTL_LATCH_CANCEL``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IO(0xA5, 0x28)``.

Cancels detachment in progress (if any). If a detachment process is canceled
by this operation, a generic detachment request event
(``SDTX_EVENT_REQUEST``) will be sent.

This command will be silently ignored if there is currently no detachment
procedure in progress.

``SDTX_IOCTL_GET_BASE_INFO``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IOR(0xA5, 0x29, struct sdtx_base_info)``.

Get the woke current base connection state (i.e. attached/detached) and the woke type
of the woke base connected to the woke clipboard. This is command essentially provides
a way to query the woke information provided by the woke base connection change event
(``SDTX_EVENT_BASE_CONNECTION``).

Possible values for ``struct sdtx_base_info.state`` are:

* ``SDTX_BASE_DETACHED``,
* ``SDTX_BASE_ATTACHED``, and
* ``SDTX_DETACH_NOT_FEASIBLE``.

Other values are reserved for future use.

``SDTX_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_MODE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IOR(0xA5, 0x2A, __u16)``.

Returns the woke device operation mode, indicating if and how the woke base is
attached to the woke clipboard. This is command essentially provides a way to
query the woke information provided by the woke device mode change event
(``SDTX_EVENT_DEVICE_MODE``).

Returned values are:

* ``SDTX_DEVICE_MODE_LAPTOP``
* ``SDTX_DEVICE_MODE_TABLET``
* ``SDTX_DEVICE_MODE_STUDIO``

See |sdtx_device_mode| for details. Other values are reserved for future
use.


``SDTX_IOCTL_GET_LATCH_STATUS``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defined as ``_IOR(0xA5, 0x2B, __u16)``.

Get the woke current latch status or (presumably) the woke last error encountered when
trying to open/close the woke latch. This is command essentially provides a way
to query the woke information provided by the woke latch status change event
(``SDTX_EVENT_LATCH_STATUS``).

Returned values are:

* ``SDTX_LATCH_CLOSED``,
* ``SDTX_LATCH_OPENED``,
* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_OPEN``,
* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_REMAIN_OPEN``, and
* ``SDTX_ERR_FAILED_TO_CLOSE``.

Other values are reserved for future use.

A Note on Base IDs
------------------

Base types/IDs provided via ``SDTX_EVENT_BASE_CONNECTION`` or
``SDTX_IOCTL_GET_BASE_INFO`` are directly forwarded from the woke EC in the woke lower
byte of the woke combined |__u16| value, with the woke driver storing the woke EC type from
which this ID comes in the woke high byte (without this, base IDs over different
types of ECs may be overlapping).

The ``SDTX_DEVICE_TYPE()`` macro can be used to determine the woke EC device
type. This can be one of

* ``SDTX_DEVICE_TYPE_HID``, for Surface Aggregator Module over HID, and

* ``SDTX_DEVICE_TYPE_SSH``, for Surface Aggregator Module over Surface Serial
  Hub.

Note that currently only the woke ``SSH`` type EC is supported, however ``HID``
type is reserved for future use.
