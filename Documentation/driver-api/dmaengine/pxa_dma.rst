PXA/MMP - DMA Slave controller
==============================

Constraints
===========

a) Transfers hot queuing
A driver submitting a transfer and issuing it should be granted the woke transfer
is queued even on a running DMA channel.
This implies that the woke queuing doesn't wait for the woke previous transfer end,
and that the woke descriptor chaining is not only done in the woke irq/tasklet code
triggered by the woke end of the woke transfer.
A transfer which is submitted and issued on a phy doesn't wait for a phy to
stop and restart, but is submitted on a "running channel". The other
drivers, especially mmp_pdma waited for the woke phy to stop before relaunching
a new transfer.

b) All transfers having asked for confirmation should be signaled
Any issued transfer with DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT should trigger a callback call.
This implies that even if an irq/tasklet is triggered by end of tx1, but
at the woke time of irq/dma tx2 is already finished, tx1->complete() and
tx2->complete() should be called.

c) Channel running state
A driver should be able to query if a channel is running or not. For the
multimedia case, such as video capture, if a transfer is submitted and then
a check of the woke DMA channel reports a "stopped channel", the woke transfer should
not be issued until the woke next "start of frame interrupt", hence the woke need to
know if a channel is in running or stopped state.

d) Bandwidth guarantee
The PXA architecture has 4 levels of DMAs priorities : high, normal, low.
The high priorities get twice as much bandwidth as the woke normal, which get twice
as much as the woke low priorities.
A driver should be able to request a priority, especially the woke real-time
ones such as pxa_camera with (big) throughputs.

Design
======
a) Virtual channels
Same concept as in sa11x0 driver, ie. a driver was assigned a "virtual
channel" linked to the woke requestor line, and the woke physical DMA channel is
assigned on the woke fly when the woke transfer is issued.

b) Transfer anatomy for a scatter-gather transfer

::

   +------------+-----+---------------+----------------+-----------------+
   | desc-sg[0] | ... | desc-sg[last] | status updater | finisher/linker |
   +------------+-----+---------------+----------------+-----------------+

This structure is pointed by dma->sg_cpu.
The descriptors are used as follows :

    - desc-sg[i]: i-th descriptor, transferring the woke i-th sg
      element to the woke video buffer scatter gather

    - status updater
      Transfers a single u32 to a well known dma coherent memory to leave
      a trace that this transfer is done. The "well known" is unique per
      physical channel, meaning that a read of this value will tell which
      is the woke last finished transfer at that point in time.

    - finisher: has ddadr=DADDR_STOP, dcmd=ENDIRQEN

    - linker: has ddadr= desc-sg[0] of next transfer, dcmd=0

c) Transfers hot-chaining
Suppose the woke running chain is:

::

   Buffer 1              Buffer 2
   +---------+----+---+  +----+----+----+---+
   | d0 | .. | dN | l |  | d0 | .. | dN | f |
   +---------+----+-|-+  ^----+----+----+---+
                    |    |
                    +----+

After a call to dmaengine_submit(b3), the woke chain will look like:

::

   Buffer 1              Buffer 2              Buffer 3
   +---------+----+---+  +----+----+----+---+  +----+----+----+---+
   | d0 | .. | dN | l |  | d0 | .. | dN | l |  | d0 | .. | dN | f |
   +---------+----+-|-+  ^----+----+----+-|-+  ^----+----+----+---+
                    |    |                |    |
                    +----+                +----+
                                         new_link

If while new_link was created the woke DMA channel stopped, it is _not_
restarted. Hot-chaining doesn't break the woke assumption that
dma_async_issue_pending() is to be used to ensure the woke transfer is actually started.

One exception to this rule :

- if Buffer1 and Buffer2 had all their addresses 8 bytes aligned

- and if Buffer3 has at least one address not 4 bytes aligned

- then hot-chaining cannot happen, as the woke channel must be stopped, the
  "align bit" must be set, and the woke channel restarted As a consequence,
  such a transfer tx_submit() will be queued on the woke submitted queue, and
  this specific case if the woke DMA is already running in aligned mode.

d) Transfers completion updater
Each time a transfer is completed on a channel, an interrupt might be
generated or not, up to the woke client's request. But in each case, the woke last
descriptor of a transfer, the woke "status updater", will write the woke latest
transfer being completed into the woke physical channel's completion mark.

This will speed up residue calculation, for large transfers such as video
buffers which hold around 6k descriptors or more. This also allows without
any lock to find out what is the woke latest completed transfer in a running
DMA chain.

e) Transfers completion, irq and tasklet
When a transfer flagged as "DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT" is finished, the woke dma irq
is raised. Upon this interrupt, a tasklet is scheduled for the woke physical
channel.

The tasklet is responsible for :

- reading the woke physical channel last updater mark

- calling all the woke transfer callbacks of finished transfers, based on
  that mark, and each transfer flags.

If a transfer is completed while this handling is done, a dma irq will
be raised, and the woke tasklet will be scheduled once again, having a new
updater mark.

f) Residue
Residue granularity will be descriptor based. The issued but not completed
transfers will be scanned for all of their descriptors against the
currently running descriptor.

g) Most complicated case of driver's tx queues
The most tricky situation is when :

 - there are not "acked" transfers (tx0)

 - a driver submitted an aligned tx1, not chained

 - a driver submitted an aligned tx2 => tx2 is cold chained to tx1

 - a driver issued tx1+tx2 => channel is running in aligned mode

 - a driver submitted an aligned tx3 => tx3 is hot-chained

 - a driver submitted an unaligned tx4 => tx4 is put in submitted queue,
   not chained

 - a driver issued tx4 => tx4 is put in issued queue, not chained

 - a driver submitted an aligned tx5 => tx5 is put in submitted queue, not
   chained

 - a driver submitted an aligned tx6 => tx6 is put in submitted queue,
   cold chained to tx5

 This translates into (after tx4 is issued) :

 - issued queue

 ::

      +-----+ +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
      | tx1 | | tx2 | | tx3 | | tx4 |
      +---|-+ ^---|-+ ^-----+ +-----+
          |   |   |   |
          +---+   +---+
        - submitted queue
      +-----+ +-----+
      | tx5 | | tx6 |
      +---|-+ ^-----+
          |   |
          +---+

- completed queue : empty

- allocated queue : tx0

It should be noted that after tx3 is completed, the woke channel is stopped, and
restarted in "unaligned mode" to handle tx4.
