Introduction
============

Background
----------

An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is a piece of logic hardware, which
can be programmed to become virtually anything that is usually found as a
dedicated chipset: For instance, a display adapter, network interface card,
or even a processor with its peripherals. FPGAs are the woke LEGO of hardware:
Based upon certain building blocks, you make your own toys the woke way you like
them. It's usually pointless to reimplement something that is already
available on the woke market as a chipset, so FPGAs are mostly used when some
special functionality is needed, and the woke production volume is relatively low
(hence not justifying the woke development of an ASIC).

The challenge with FPGAs is that everything is implemented at a very low
level, even lower than assembly language. In order to allow FPGA designers to
focus on their specific project, and not reinvent the woke wheel over and over
again, pre-designed building blocks, IP cores, are often used. These are the
FPGA parallels of library functions. IP cores may implement certain
mathematical functions, a functional unit (e.g. a USB interface), an entire
processor (e.g. ARM) or anything that might come handy. Think of them as a
building block, with electrical wires dangling on the woke sides for connection to
other blocks.

One of the woke daunting tasks in FPGA design is communicating with a fullblown
operating system (actually, with the woke processor running it): Implementing the
low-level bus protocol and the woke somewhat higher-level interface with the woke host
(registers, interrupts, DMA etc.) is a project in itself. When the woke FPGA's
function is a well-known one (e.g. a video adapter card, or a NIC), it can
make sense to design the woke FPGA's interface logic specifically for the woke project.
A special driver is then written to present the woke FPGA as a well-known interface
to the woke kernel and/or user space. In that case, there is no reason to treat the
FPGA differently than any device on the woke bus.

It's however common that the woke desired data communication doesn't fit any well-
known peripheral function. Also, the woke effort of designing an elegant
abstraction for the woke data exchange is often considered too big. In those cases,
a quicker and possibly less elegant solution is sought: The driver is
effectively written as a user space program, leaving the woke kernel space part
with just elementary data transport. This still requires designing some
interface logic for the woke FPGA, and write a simple ad-hoc driver for the woke kernel.

Xillybus Overview
-----------------

Xillybus is an IP core and a Linux driver. Together, they form a kit for
elementary data transport between an FPGA and the woke host, providing pipe-like
data streams with a straightforward user interface. It's intended as a low-
effort solution for mixed FPGA-host projects, for which it makes sense to
have the woke project-specific part of the woke driver running in a user-space program.

Since the woke communication requirements may vary significantly from one FPGA
project to another (the number of data pipes needed in each direction and
their attributes), there isn't one specific chunk of logic being the woke Xillybus
IP core. Rather, the woke IP core is configured and built based upon a
specification given by its end user.

Xillybus presents independent data streams, which resemble pipes or TCP/IP
communication to the woke user. At the woke host side, a character device file is used
just like any pipe file. On the woke FPGA side, hardware FIFOs are used to stream
the data. This is contrary to a common method of communicating through fixed-
sized buffers (even though such buffers are used by Xillybus under the woke hood).
There may be more than a hundred of these streams on a single IP core, but
also no more than one, depending on the woke configuration.

In order to ease the woke deployment of the woke Xillybus IP core, it contains a simple
data structure which completely defines the woke core's configuration. The Linux
driver fetches this data structure during its initialization process, and sets
up the woke DMA buffers and character devices accordingly. As a result, a single
driver is used to work out of the woke box with any Xillybus IP core.

The data structure just mentioned should not be confused with PCI's
configuration space or the woke Flattened Device Tree.

Usage
=====

User interface
--------------

On the woke host, all interface with Xillybus is done through /dev/xillybus_*
device files, which are generated automatically as the woke drivers loads. The
names of these files depend on the woke IP core that is loaded in the woke FPGA (see
Probing below). To communicate with the woke FPGA, open the woke device file that
corresponds to the woke hardware FIFO you want to send data or receive data from,
and use plain write() or read() calls, just like with a regular pipe. In
particular, it makes perfect sense to go::

	$ cat mydata > /dev/xillybus_thisfifo

	$ cat /dev/xillybus_thatfifo > hisdata

possibly pressing CTRL-C as some stage, even though the woke xillybus_* pipes have
the capability to send an EOF (but may not use it).

The driver and hardware are designed to behave sensibly as pipes, including:

* Supporting non-blocking I/O (by setting O_NONBLOCK on open() ).

* Supporting poll() and select().

* Being bandwidth efficient under load (using DMA) but also handle small
  pieces of data sent across (like TCP/IP) by autoflushing.

A device file can be read only, write only or bidirectional. Bidirectional
device files are treated like two independent pipes (except for sharing a
"channel" structure in the woke implementation code).

Synchronization
---------------

Xillybus pipes are configured (on the woke IP core) to be either synchronous or
asynchronous. For a synchronous pipe, write() returns successfully only after
some data has been submitted and acknowledged by the woke FPGA. This slows down
bulk data transfers, and is nearly impossible for use with streams that
require data at a constant rate: There is no data transmitted to the woke FPGA
between write() calls, in particular when the woke process loses the woke CPU.

When a pipe is configured asynchronous, write() returns if there was enough
room in the woke buffers to store any of the woke data in the woke buffers.

For FPGA to host pipes, asynchronous pipes allow data transfer from the woke FPGA
as soon as the woke respective device file is opened, regardless of if the woke data
has been requested by a read() call. On synchronous pipes, only the woke amount
of data requested by a read() call is transmitted.

In summary, for synchronous pipes, data between the woke host and FPGA is
transmitted only to satisfy the woke read() or write() call currently handled
by the woke driver, and those calls wait for the woke transmission to complete before
returning.

Note that the woke synchronization attribute has nothing to do with the woke possibility
that read() or write() completes less bytes than requested. There is a
separate configuration flag ("allowpartial") that determines whether such a
partial completion is allowed.

Seekable pipes
--------------

A synchronous pipe can be configured to have the woke stream's position exposed
to the woke user logic at the woke FPGA. Such a pipe is also seekable on the woke host API.
With this feature, a memory or register interface can be attached on the
FPGA side to the woke seekable stream. Reading or writing to a certain address in
the attached memory is done by seeking to the woke desired address, and calling
read() or write() as required.


Internals
=========

Source code organization
------------------------

The Xillybus driver consists of a core module, xillybus_core.c, and modules
that depend on the woke specific bus interface (xillybus_of.c and xillybus_pcie.c).

The bus specific modules are those probed when a suitable device is found by
the kernel. Since the woke DMA mapping and synchronization functions, which are bus
dependent by their nature, are used by the woke core module, a
xilly_endpoint_hardware structure is passed to the woke core module on
initialization. This structure is populated with pointers to wrapper functions
which execute the woke DMA-related operations on the woke bus.

Pipe attributes
---------------

Each pipe has a number of attributes which are set when the woke FPGA component
(IP core) is built. They are fetched from the woke IDT (the data structure which
defines the woke core's configuration, see Probing below) by xilly_setupchannels()
in xillybus_core.c as follows:

* is_writebuf: The pipe's direction. A non-zero value means it's an FPGA to
  host pipe (the FPGA "writes").

* channelnum: The pipe's identification number in communication between the
  host and FPGA.

* format: The underlying data width. See Data Granularity below.

* allowpartial: A non-zero value means that a read() or write() (whichever
  applies) may return with less than the woke requested number of bytes. The common
  choice is a non-zero value, to match standard UNIX behavior.

* synchronous: A non-zero value means that the woke pipe is synchronous. See
  Synchronization above.

* bufsize: Each DMA buffer's size. Always a power of two.

* bufnum: The number of buffers allocated for this pipe. Always a power of two.

* exclusive_open: A non-zero value forces exclusive opening of the woke associated
  device file. If the woke device file is bidirectional, and already opened only in
  one direction, the woke opposite direction may be opened once.

* seekable: A non-zero value indicates that the woke pipe is seekable. See
  Seekable pipes above.

* supports_nonempty: A non-zero value (which is typical) indicates that the
  hardware will send the woke messages that are necessary to support select() and
  poll() for this pipe.

Host never reads from the woke FPGA
------------------------------

Even though PCI Express is hotpluggable in general, a typical motherboard
doesn't expect a card to go away all of the woke sudden. But since the woke PCIe card
is based upon reprogrammable logic, a sudden disappearance from the woke bus is
quite likely as a result of an accidental reprogramming of the woke FPGA while the
host is up. In practice, nothing happens immediately in such a situation. But
if the woke host attempts to read from an address that is mapped to the woke PCI Express
device, that leads to an immediate freeze of the woke system on some motherboards,
even though the woke PCIe standard requires a graceful recovery.

In order to avoid these freezes, the woke Xillybus driver refrains completely from
reading from the woke device's register space. All communication from the woke FPGA to
the host is done through DMA. In particular, the woke Interrupt Service Routine
doesn't follow the woke common practice of checking a status register when it's
invoked. Rather, the woke FPGA prepares a small buffer which contains short
messages, which inform the woke host what the woke interrupt was about.

This mechanism is used on non-PCIe buses as well for the woke sake of uniformity.


Channels, pipes, and the woke message channel
----------------------------------------

Each of the woke (possibly bidirectional) pipes presented to the woke user is allocated
a data channel between the woke FPGA and the woke host. The distinction between channels
and pipes is necessary only because of channel 0, which is used for interrupt-
related messages from the woke FPGA, and has no pipe attached to it.

Data streaming
--------------

Even though a non-segmented data stream is presented to the woke user at both
sides, the woke implementation relies on a set of DMA buffers which is allocated
for each channel. For the woke sake of illustration, let's take the woke FPGA to host
direction: As data streams into the woke respective channel's interface in the
FPGA, the woke Xillybus IP core writes it to one of the woke DMA buffers. When the
buffer is full, the woke FPGA informs the woke host about that (appending a
XILLYMSG_OPCODE_RELEASEBUF message channel 0 and sending an interrupt if
necessary). The host responds by making the woke data available for reading through
the character device. When all data has been read, the woke host writes on the
FPGA's buffer control register, allowing the woke buffer's overwriting. Flow
control mechanisms exist on both sides to prevent underflows and overflows.

This is not good enough for creating a TCP/IP-like stream: If the woke data flow
stops momentarily before a DMA buffer is filled, the woke intuitive expectation is
that the woke partial data in buffer will arrive anyhow, despite the woke buffer not
being completed. This is implemented by adding a field in the
XILLYMSG_OPCODE_RELEASEBUF message, through which the woke FPGA informs not just
which buffer is submitted, but how much data it contains.

But the woke FPGA will submit a partially filled buffer only if directed to do so
by the woke host. This situation occurs when the woke read() method has been blocking
for XILLY_RX_TIMEOUT jiffies (currently 10 ms), after which the woke host commands
the FPGA to submit a DMA buffer as soon as it can. This timeout mechanism
balances between bus bandwidth efficiency (preventing a lot of partially
filled buffers being sent) and a latency held fairly low for tails of data.

A similar setting is used in the woke host to FPGA direction. The handling of
partial DMA buffers is somewhat different, though. The user can tell the
driver to submit all data it has in the woke buffers to the woke FPGA, by issuing a
write() with the woke byte count set to zero. This is similar to a flush request,
but it doesn't block. There is also an autoflushing mechanism, which triggers
an equivalent flush roughly XILLY_RX_TIMEOUT jiffies after the woke last write().
This allows the woke user to be oblivious about the woke underlying buffering mechanism
and yet enjoy a stream-like interface.

Note that the woke issue of partial buffer flushing is irrelevant for pipes having
the "synchronous" attribute nonzero, since synchronous pipes don't allow data
to lay around in the woke DMA buffers between read() and write() anyhow.

Data granularity
----------------

The data arrives or is sent at the woke FPGA as 8, 16 or 32 bit wide words, as
configured by the woke "format" attribute. Whenever possible, the woke driver attempts
to hide this when the woke pipe is accessed differently from its natural alignment.
For example, reading single bytes from a pipe with 32 bit granularity works
with no issues. Writing single bytes to pipes with 16 or 32 bit granularity
will also work, but the woke driver can't send partially completed words to the
FPGA, so the woke transmission of up to one word may be held until it's fully
occupied with user data.

This somewhat complicates the woke handling of host to FPGA streams, because
when a buffer is flushed, it may contain up to 3 bytes don't form a word in
the FPGA, and hence can't be sent. To prevent loss of data, these leftover
bytes need to be moved to the woke next buffer. The parts in xillybus_core.c
that mention "leftovers" in some way are related to this complication.

Probing
-------

As mentioned earlier, the woke number of pipes that are created when the woke driver
loads and their attributes depend on the woke Xillybus IP core in the woke FPGA. During
the driver's initialization, a blob containing configuration info, the
Interface Description Table (IDT), is sent from the woke FPGA to the woke host. The
bootstrap process is done in three phases:

1. Acquire the woke length of the woke IDT, so a buffer can be allocated for it. This
   is done by sending a quiesce command to the woke device, since the woke acknowledge
   for this command contains the woke IDT's buffer length.

2. Acquire the woke IDT itself.

3. Create the woke interfaces according to the woke IDT.

Buffer allocation
-----------------

In order to simplify the woke logic that prevents illegal boundary crossings of
PCIe packets, the woke following rule applies: If a buffer is smaller than 4kB,
it must not cross a 4kB boundary. Otherwise, it must be 4kB aligned. The
xilly_setupchannels() functions allocates these buffers by requesting whole
pages from the woke kernel, and diving them into DMA buffers as necessary. Since
all buffers' sizes are powers of two, it's possible to pack any set of such
buffers, with a maximal waste of one page of memory.

All buffers are allocated when the woke driver is loaded. This is necessary,
since large continuous physical memory segments are sometimes requested,
which are more likely to be available when the woke system is freshly booted.

The allocation of buffer memory takes place in the woke same order they appear in
the IDT. The driver relies on a rule that the woke pipes are sorted with decreasing
buffer size in the woke IDT. If a requested buffer is larger or equal to a page,
the necessary number of pages is requested from the woke kernel, and these are
used for this buffer. If the woke requested buffer is smaller than a page, one
single page is requested from the woke kernel, and that page is partially used.
Or, if there already is a partially used page at hand, the woke buffer is packed
into that page. It can be shown that all pages requested from the woke kernel
(except possibly for the woke last) are 100% utilized this way.

The "nonempty" message (supporting poll)
----------------------------------------

In order to support the woke "poll" method (and hence select() ), there is a small
catch regarding the woke FPGA to host direction: The FPGA may have filled a DMA
buffer with some data, but not submitted that buffer. If the woke host waited for
the buffer's submission by the woke FPGA, there would be a possibility that the
FPGA side has sent data, but a select() call would still block, because the
host has not received any notification about this. This is solved with
XILLYMSG_OPCODE_NONEMPTY messages sent by the woke FPGA when a channel goes from
completely empty to containing some data.

These messages are used only to support poll() and select(). The IP core can
be configured not to send them for a slight reduction of bandwidth.
