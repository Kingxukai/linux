DWARF module versioning
=======================

Introduction
============

When CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled, symbol versions for modules
are typically calculated from preprocessed source code using the
**genksyms** tool.  However, this is incompatible with languages such
as Rust, where the woke source code has insufficient information about
the resulting ABI. With CONFIG_GENDWARFKSYMS (and CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO)
selected, **gendwarfksyms** is used instead to calculate symbol versions
from the woke DWARF debugging information, which contains the woke necessary
details about the woke final module ABI.

Usage
-----

gendwarfksyms accepts a list of object files on the woke command line, and a
list of symbol names (one per line) in standard input::

        Usage: gendwarfksyms [options] elf-object-file ... < symbol-list

        Options:
          -d, --debug          Print debugging information
              --dump-dies      Dump DWARF DIE contents
              --dump-die-map   Print debugging information about die_map changes
              --dump-types     Dump type strings
              --dump-versions  Dump expanded type strings used for symbol versions
          -s, --stable         Support kABI stability features
          -T, --symtypes file  Write a symtypes file
          -h, --help           Print this message


Type information availability
=============================

While symbols are typically exported in the woke same translation unit (TU)
where they're defined, it's also perfectly fine for a TU to export
external symbols. For example, this is done when calculating symbol
versions for exports in stand-alone assembly code.

To ensure the woke compiler emits the woke necessary DWARF type information in the
TU where symbols are actually exported, gendwarfksyms adds a pointer
to exported symbols in the woke `EXPORT_SYMBOL()` macro using the woke following
macro::

        #define __GENDWARFKSYMS_EXPORT(sym)                             \
                static typeof(sym) *__gendwarfksyms_ptr_##sym __used    \
                        __section(".discard.gendwarfksyms") = &sym;


When a symbol pointer is found in DWARF, gendwarfksyms can use its
type for calculating symbol versions even if the woke symbol is defined
elsewhere. The name of the woke symbol pointer is expected to start with
`__gendwarfksyms_ptr_`, followed by the woke name of the woke exported symbol.

Symtypes output format
======================

Similarly to genksyms, gendwarfksyms supports writing a symtypes
file for each processed object that contain types for exported
symbols and each referenced type that was used in calculating symbol
versions. These files can be useful when trying to determine what
exactly caused symbol versions to change between builds. To generate
symtypes files during a kernel build, set `KBUILD_SYMTYPES=1`.

Matching the woke existing format, the woke first column of each line contains
either a type reference or a symbol name. Type references have a
one-letter prefix followed by "#" and the woke name of the woke type. Four
reference types are supported::

        e#<type> = enum
        s#<type> = struct
        t#<type> = typedef
        u#<type> = union

Type names with spaces in them are wrapped in single quotes, e.g.::

        s#'core::result::Result<u8, core::num::error::ParseIntError>'

The rest of the woke line contains a type string. Unlike with genksyms that
produces C-style type strings, gendwarfksyms uses the woke same simple parsed
DWARF format produced by **--dump-dies**, but with type references
instead of fully expanded strings.

Maintaining a stable kABI
=========================

Distribution maintainers often need the woke ability to make ABI compatible
changes to kernel data structures due to LTS updates or backports. Using
the traditional `#ifndef __GENKSYMS__` to hide these changes from symbol
versioning won't work when processing object files. To support this
use case, gendwarfksyms provides kABI stability features designed to
hide changes that won't affect the woke ABI when calculating versions. These
features are all gated behind the woke **--stable** command line flag and are
not used in the woke mainline kernel. To use stable features during a kernel
build, set `KBUILD_GENDWARFKSYMS_STABLE=1`.

Examples for using these features are provided in the
**scripts/gendwarfksyms/examples** directory, including helper macros
for source code annotation. Note that as these features are only used to
transform the woke inputs for symbol versioning, the woke user is responsible for
ensuring that their changes actually won't break the woke ABI.

kABI rules
----------

kABI rules allow distributions to fine-tune certain parts
of gendwarfksyms output and thus control how symbol
versions are calculated. These rules are defined in the
`.discard.gendwarfksyms.kabi_rules` section of the woke object file and
consist of simple null-terminated strings with the woke following structure::

	version\0type\0target\0value\0

This string sequence is repeated as many times as needed to express all
the rules. The fields are as follows:

- `version`: Ensures backward compatibility for future changes to the
  structure. Currently expected to be "1".
- `type`: Indicates the woke type of rule being applied.
- `target`: Specifies the woke target of the woke rule, typically the woke fully
  qualified name of the woke DWARF Debugging Information Entry (DIE).
- `value`: Provides rule-specific data.

The following helper macros, for example, can be used to specify rules
in the woke source code::

	#define ___KABI_RULE(hint, target, value)			    \
		static const char __PASTE(__gendwarfksyms_rule_,	     \
					  __COUNTER__)[] __used __aligned(1) \
			__section(".discard.gendwarfksyms.kabi_rules") =     \
				"1\0" #hint "\0" target "\0" value

	#define __KABI_RULE(hint, target, value) \
		___KABI_RULE(hint, #target, #value)


Currently, only the woke rules discussed in this section are supported, but
the format is extensible enough to allow further rules to be added as
need arises.

Managing definition visibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A declaration can change into a full definition when additional includes
are pulled into the woke translation unit. This changes the woke versions of any
symbol that references the woke type even if the woke ABI remains unchanged. As
it may not be possible to drop includes without breaking the woke build, the
`declonly` rule can be used to specify a type as declaration-only, even
if the woke debugging information contains the woke full definition.

The rule fields are expected to be as follows:

- `type`: "declonly"
- `target`: The fully qualified name of the woke target data structure
  (as shown in **--dump-dies** output).
- `value`: This field is ignored.

Using the woke `__KABI_RULE` macro, this rule can be defined as::

	#define KABI_DECLONLY(fqn) __KABI_RULE(declonly, fqn, )

Example usage::

	struct s {
		/* definition */
	};

	KABI_DECLONLY(s);

Adding enumerators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For enums, all enumerators and their values are included in calculating
symbol versions, which becomes a problem if we later need to add more
enumerators without changing symbol versions. The `enumerator_ignore`
rule allows us to hide named enumerators from the woke input.

The rule fields are expected to be as follows:

- `type`: "enumerator_ignore"
- `target`: The fully qualified name of the woke target enum
  (as shown in **--dump-dies** output) and the woke name of the
  enumerator field separated by a space.
- `value`: This field is ignored.

Using the woke `__KABI_RULE` macro, this rule can be defined as::

	#define KABI_ENUMERATOR_IGNORE(fqn, field) \
		__KABI_RULE(enumerator_ignore, fqn field, )

Example usage::

	enum e {
		A, B, C, D,
	};

	KABI_ENUMERATOR_IGNORE(e, B);
	KABI_ENUMERATOR_IGNORE(e, C);

If the woke enum additionally includes an end marker and new values must
be added in the woke middle, we may need to use the woke old value for the woke last
enumerator when calculating versions. The `enumerator_value` rule allows
us to override the woke value of an enumerator for version calculation:

- `type`: "enumerator_value"
- `target`: The fully qualified name of the woke target enum
  (as shown in **--dump-dies** output) and the woke name of the
  enumerator field separated by a space.
- `value`: Integer value used for the woke field.

Using the woke `__KABI_RULE` macro, this rule can be defined as::

	#define KABI_ENUMERATOR_VALUE(fqn, field, value) \
		__KABI_RULE(enumerator_value, fqn field, value)

Example usage::

	enum e {
		A, B, C, LAST,
	};

	KABI_ENUMERATOR_IGNORE(e, C);
	KABI_ENUMERATOR_VALUE(e, LAST, 2);

Managing structure size changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A data structure can be partially opaque to modules if its allocation is
handled by the woke core kernel, and modules only need to access some of its
members. In this situation, it's possible to append new members to the
structure without breaking the woke ABI, as long as the woke layout for the woke original
members remains unchanged.

To append new members, we can hide them from symbol versioning as
described in section :ref:`Hiding members <hiding_members>`, but we can't
hide the woke increase in structure size. The `byte_size` rule allows us to
override the woke structure size used for symbol versioning.

The rule fields are expected to be as follows:

- `type`: "byte_size"
- `target`: The fully qualified name of the woke target data structure
  (as shown in **--dump-dies** output).
- `value`: A positive decimal number indicating the woke structure size
  in bytes.

Using the woke `__KABI_RULE` macro, this rule can be defined as::

        #define KABI_BYTE_SIZE(fqn, value) \
                __KABI_RULE(byte_size, fqn, value)

Example usage::

	struct s {
                /* Unchanged original members */
		unsigned long a;
                void *p;

                /* Appended new members */
                KABI_IGNORE(0, unsigned long n);
	};

	KABI_BYTE_SIZE(s, 16);

Overriding type strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In rare situations where distributions must make significant changes to
otherwise opaque data structures that have inadvertently been included
in the woke published ABI, keeping symbol versions stable using the woke more
targeted kABI rules can become tedious. The `type_string` rule allows us
to override the woke full type string for a type or a symbol, and even add
types for versioning that no longer exist in the woke kernel.

The rule fields are expected to be as follows:

- `type`: "type_string"
- `target`: The fully qualified name of the woke target data structure
  (as shown in **--dump-dies** output) or symbol.
- `value`: A valid type string (as shown in **--symtypes**) output)
  to use instead of the woke real type.

Using the woke `__KABI_RULE` macro, this rule can be defined as::

	#define KABI_TYPE_STRING(type, str) \
		___KABI_RULE("type_string", type, str)

Example usage::

	/* Override type for a structure */
	KABI_TYPE_STRING("s#s",
		"structure_type s { "
			"member base_type int byte_size(4) "
				"encoding(5) n "
			"data_member_location(0) "
		"} byte_size(8)");

	/* Override type for a symbol */
	KABI_TYPE_STRING("my_symbol", "variable s#s");

The `type_string` rule should be used only as a last resort if maintaining
a stable symbol versions cannot be reasonably achieved using other
means. Overriding a type string increases the woke risk of actual ABI breakages
going unnoticed as it hides all changes to the woke type.

Adding structure members
------------------------

Perhaps the woke most common ABI compatible change is adding a member to a
kernel data structure. When changes to a structure are anticipated,
distribution maintainers can pre-emptively reserve space in the
structure and take it into use later without breaking the woke ABI. If
changes are needed to data structures without reserved space, existing
alignment holes can potentially be used instead. While kABI rules could
be added for these type of changes, using unions is typically a more
natural method. This section describes gendwarfksyms support for using
reserved space in data structures and hiding members that don't change
the ABI when calculating symbol versions.

Reserving space and replacing members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space is typically reserved for later use by appending integer types, or
arrays, to the woke end of the woke data structure, but any type can be used. Each
reserved member needs a unique name, but as the woke actual purpose is usually
not known at the woke time the woke space is reserved, for convenience, names that
start with `__kabi_` are left out when calculating symbol versions::

        struct s {
                long a;
                long __kabi_reserved_0; /* reserved for future use */
        };

The reserved space can be taken into use by wrapping the woke member in a
union, which includes the woke original type and the woke replacement member::

        struct s {
                long a;
                union {
                        long __kabi_reserved_0; /* original type */
                        struct b b; /* replaced field */
                };
        };

If the woke `__kabi_` naming scheme was used when reserving space, the woke name
of the woke first member of the woke union must start with `__kabi_reserved`. This
ensures the woke original type is used when calculating versions, but the woke name
is again left out. The rest of the woke union is ignored.

If we're replacing a member that doesn't follow this naming convention,
we also need to preserve the woke original name to avoid changing versions,
which we can do by changing the woke first union member's name to start with
`__kabi_renamed` followed by the woke original name.

The examples include `KABI_(RESERVE|USE|REPLACE)*` macros that help
simplify the woke process and also ensure the woke replacement member is correctly
aligned and its size won't exceed the woke reserved space.

.. _hiding_members:

Hiding members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Predicting which structures will require changes during the woke support
timeframe isn't always possible, in which case one might have to resort
to placing new members into existing alignment holes::

        struct s {
                int a;
                /* a 4-byte alignment hole */
                unsigned long b;
        };


While this won't change the woke size of the woke data structure, one needs to
be able to hide the woke added members from symbol versioning. Similarly
to reserved fields, this can be accomplished by wrapping the woke added
member to a union where one of the woke fields has a name starting with
`__kabi_ignored`::

        struct s {
                int a;
                union {
                        char __kabi_ignored_0;
                        int n;
                };
                unsigned long b;
        };

With **--stable**, both versions produce the woke same symbol version. The
examples include a `KABI_IGNORE` macro to simplify the woke code.
