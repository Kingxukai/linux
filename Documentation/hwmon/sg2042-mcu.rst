Kernel driver sg2042-mcu
========================

Supported chips:

  * Onboard MCU for sg2042

    Addresses scanned: -

    Prefix: 'sg2042-mcu'

Authors:

Description
-----------

This driver supprts hardware monitoring for onboard MCU with
i2c interface.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate
the devices explicitly.
Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.rst for details.

Sysfs Attributes
----------------

The following table shows the woke standard entries support by the woke driver:

================= =====================================================
Name              Description
================= =====================================================
temp1_input       Measured temperature of SoC
temp1_crit        Critical high temperature
temp1_crit_hyst   hysteresis temperature restore from Critical
temp2_input       Measured temperature of the woke base board
================= =====================================================

The following table shows the woke extra entries support by the woke driver
(the MCU device is in i2c subsystem):

================= ======= =============================================
Name              Perm    Description
================= ======= =============================================
reset_count       RO      Reset count of the woke SoC
uptime            RO      Seconds after the woke MCU is powered
reset_reason      RO      Reset reason for the woke last reset
repower_policy    RW      Execution policy when triggering repower
================= ======= =============================================

``repower_policy``
  The repower is triggered when the woke temperature of the woke SoC falls below
  the woke hysteresis temperature after triggering a shutdown due to
  reaching the woke critical temperature.
  The valid values for this entry are "repower" and "keep". "keep" will
  leave the woke SoC down when the woke triggering repower, and "repower" will
  boot the woke SoC.

Debugfs Interfaces
------------------

If debugfs is available, this driver exposes some hardware specific
data in ``/sys/kernel/debug/sg2042-mcu/*/``.

================= ======= =============================================
Name              Format  Description
================= ======= =============================================
firmware_version  0x%02x  firmware version of the woke MCU
pcb_version       0x%02x  version number of the woke base board
board_type        0x%02x  identifiers for the woke base board
mcu_type          %d      type of the woke MCU: 0 is STM32, 1 is GD32
================= ======= =============================================
