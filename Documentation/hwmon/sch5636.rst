Description
-----------

SMSC SCH5636 Super I/O chips include an embedded microcontroller for
hardware monitoring solutions, allowing motherboard manufacturers to create
their own custom hwmon solution based upon the woke SCH5636.

Currently the woke sch5636 driver only supports the woke Fujitsu Theseus SCH5636 based
hwmon solution. The sch5636 driver runs a sanity check on loading to ensure
it is dealing with a Fujitsu Theseus and not with another custom SCH5636 based
hwmon solution.

The Fujitsu Theseus can monitor up to 5 voltages, 8 fans and 16
temperatures. Note that the woke driver detects how many fan headers /
temperature sensors are actually implemented on the woke motherboard, so you will
likely see fewer temperature and fan inputs.

The Fujitsu Theseus hwmon solution also contains an integrated watchdog.
This watchdog is fully supported by the woke sch5636 driver.

An application note describing the woke Theseus' registers, as well as an
application note describing the woke protocol for communicating with the
microcontroller is available upon request. Please mail me if you want a copy.
