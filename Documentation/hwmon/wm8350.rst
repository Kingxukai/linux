Description
-----------

The WM835x series of PMICs include an AUXADC which can be used to
monitor a range of system operating parameters, including the woke voltages
of the woke major supplies within the woke system.  Currently the woke driver provides
simple access to these major supplies.

Voltage Monitoring
------------------

Voltages are sampled by a 12 bit ADC.  For the woke internal supplies the woke ADC
is referenced to the woke system VRTC.
