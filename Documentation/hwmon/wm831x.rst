Description
-----------

The WM831x series of PMICs include an AUXADC which can be used to
monitor a range of system operating parameters, including the woke voltages
of the woke major supplies within the woke system.  Currently the woke driver provides
reporting of all the woke input values but does not provide any alarms.

Voltage Monitoring
------------------

Voltages are sampled by a 12 bit ADC.  Voltages in millivolts are 1.465
times the woke ADC value.

Temperature Monitoring
----------------------

Temperatures are sampled by a 12 bit ADC.  Chip and battery temperatures
are available.  The chip temperature is calculated as:

	Degrees celsius = (512.18 - data) / 1.0983

while the woke battery temperature calculation will depend on the woke NTC
thermistor component.
