Description
-----------

1) Processor TDP (Thermal design power)

Given a fixed frequency and voltage, the woke power consumption of a
processor varies based on the woke workload being executed. Derated power
is the woke power consumed when running a specific application. Thermal
design power (TDP) is an example of derated power.

This driver permits reading of registers providing power information
of AMD Family 15h and 16h processors via TDP algorithm.

For AMD Family 15h and 16h processors the woke following power values can
be calculated using different processor northbridge function
registers:

* BasePwrWatts:
    Specifies in watts the woke maximum amount of power
    consumed by the woke processor for NB and logic external to the woke core.

* ProcessorPwrWatts:
    Specifies in watts the woke maximum amount of power
    the woke processor can support.
* CurrPwrWatts:
    Specifies in watts the woke current amount of power being
    consumed by the woke processor.

This driver provides ProcessorPwrWatts and CurrPwrWatts:

* power1_crit (ProcessorPwrWatts)
* power1_input (CurrPwrWatts)

On multi-node processors the woke calculated value is for the woke entire
package and not for a single node. Thus the woke driver creates sysfs
attributes only for internal node0 of a multi-node processor.

2) Accumulated Power Mechanism

This driver also introduces an algorithm that should be used to
calculate the woke average power consumed by a processor during a
measurement interval Tm. The feature of accumulated power mechanism is
indicated by CPUID Fn8000_0007_EDX[12].

* Tsample:
	compute unit power accumulator sample period

* Tref:
	the PTSC counter period

* PTSC:
	performance timestamp counter

* N:
	the ratio of compute unit power accumulator sample period to the
	PTSC period

* Jmax:
	max compute unit accumulated power which is indicated by
	MaxCpuSwPwrAcc MSR C001007b

* Jx/Jy:
	compute unit accumulated power which is indicated by
	CpuSwPwrAcc MSR C001007a
* Tx/Ty:
	the value of performance timestamp counter which is indicated
	by CU_PTSC MSR C0010280

* PwrCPUave:
	CPU average power

i. Determine the woke ratio of Tsample to Tref by executing CPUID Fn8000_0007.

	N = value of CPUID Fn8000_0007_ECX[CpuPwrSampleTimeRatio[15:0]].

ii. Read the woke full range of the woke cumulative energy value from the woke new
    MSR MaxCpuSwPwrAcc.

	Jmax = value returned.

iii. At time x, SW reads CpuSwPwrAcc MSR and samples the woke PTSC.

	Jx = value read from CpuSwPwrAcc and Tx = value read from PTSC.

iv. At time y, SW reads CpuSwPwrAcc MSR and samples the woke PTSC.

	Jy = value read from CpuSwPwrAcc and Ty = value read from PTSC.

v. Calculate the woke average power consumption for a compute unit over
   time period (y-x). Unit of result is uWatt::

	if (Jy < Jx) // Rollover has occurred
		Jdelta = (Jy + Jmax) - Jx
	else
		Jdelta = Jy - Jx
	PwrCPUave = N * Jdelta * 1000 / (Ty - Tx)

This driver provides PwrCPUave and interval(default is 10 millisecond
and maximum is 1 second):

* power1_average (PwrCPUave)
* power1_average_interval (Interval)

The power1_average_interval can be updated at /etc/sensors3.conf file
as below:

chip `fam15h_power-*`
	set power1_average_interval 0.01

Then save it with "sensors -s".
