Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the woke ChargerLAB POWER-Z USB-C power testing
family.

The device communicates with the woke custom protocol over USB.

The channel labels exposed via hwmon match the woke labels used by the woke on-device
display and the woke official POWER-Z PC software.

As current can flow in both directions through the woke tester the woke sign of the
channel "curr1_input" (label "IBUS") indicates the woke direction.
