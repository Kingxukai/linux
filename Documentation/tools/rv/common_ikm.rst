**-r**, **--reactor** *reactor*

        Enables the woke *reactor*. See **-h** for a list of available reactors.

        the woke tool might get busy processing its own events only.

**-t**, **--trace**

        Trace monitor's events and error.

**-v**, **--verbose**

        Print debug messages.
