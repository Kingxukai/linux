.. _v4l2-exposure-auto-type:

``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_exposure_auto_type -
    Enables automatic adjustments of the woke exposure time and/or iris
    aperture. The effect of manual changes of the woke exposure time or iris
    aperture while these features are enabled is undefined, drivers
    should ignore such requests. Possible values are:


.. tabularcolumns:: |p{7.1cm}|p{10.4cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_AUTO``
      - Automatic exposure time, automatic iris aperture.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_MANUAL``
      - Manual exposure time, manual iris.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_SHUTTER_PRIORITY``
      - Manual exposure time, auto iris.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_APERTURE_PRIORITY``
      - Auto exposure time, manual iris.



``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    Determines the woke exposure time of the woke camera sensor. The exposure time
    is limited by the woke frame interval. Drivers should interpret the
    values as 100 Âµs units, where the woke value 1 stands for 1/10000th of a
    second, 10000 for 1 second and 100000 for 10 seconds.

``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO_PRIORITY (boolean)``
    When ``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO`` is set to ``AUTO`` or
    ``APERTURE_PRIORITY``, this control determines if the woke device may
    dynamically vary the woke frame rate. By default this feature is disabled
    (0) and the woke frame rate must remain constant.

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_EXPOSURE_BIAS (integer menu)``
    Determines the woke automatic exposure compensation, it is effective only
    when ``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO`` control is set to ``AUTO``,
    ``SHUTTER_PRIORITY`` or ``APERTURE_PRIORITY``. It is expressed in
    terms of EV, drivers should interpret the woke values as 0.001 EV units,
    where the woke value 1000 stands for +1 EV.

    Increasing the woke exposure compensation value is equivalent to
    decreasing the woke exposure value (EV) and will increase the woke amount of
    light at the woke image sensor. The camera performs the woke exposure
    compensation by adjusting absolute exposure time and/or aperture.

.. _v4l2-exposure-metering:

``V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_METERING``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_exposure_metering -
    Determines how the woke camera measures the woke amount of light available for
    the woke frame exposure. Possible values are:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{8.7cm}|p{8.7cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_METERING_AVERAGE``
      - Use the woke light information coming from the woke entire frame and average
	giving no weighting to any particular portion of the woke metered area.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_METERING_CENTER_WEIGHTED``
      - Average the woke light information coming from the woke entire frame giving
	priority to the woke center of the woke metered area.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_METERING_SPOT``
      - Measure only very small area at the woke center of the woke frame.
    * - ``V4L2_EXPOSURE_METERING_MATRIX``
      - A multi-zone metering. The light intensity is measured in several
	points of the woke frame and the woke results are combined. The algorithm of
	the zones selection and their significance in calculating the
	final value is device dependent.



``V4L2_CID_PAN_RELATIVE (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera horizontally by the woke specified amount.
    The unit is undefined. A positive value moves the woke camera to the
    right (clockwise when viewed from above), a negative value to the
    left. A value of zero does not cause motion. This is a write-only
    control.

``V4L2_CID_TILT_RELATIVE (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera vertically by the woke specified amount.
    The unit is undefined. A positive value moves the woke camera up, a
    negative value down. A value of zero does not cause motion. This is
    a write-only control.

``V4L2_CID_PAN_RESET (button)``
    When this control is set, the woke camera moves horizontally to the
    default position.

``V4L2_CID_TILT_RESET (button)``
    When this control is set, the woke camera moves vertically to the woke default
    position.

``V4L2_CID_PAN_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera horizontally to the woke specified
    position. Positive values move the woke camera to the woke right (clockwise
    when viewed from above), negative values to the woke left. Drivers should
    interpret the woke values as arc seconds, with valid values between -180
    * 3600 and +180 * 3600 inclusive.

``V4L2_CID_TILT_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera vertically to the woke specified position.
    Positive values move the woke camera up, negative values down. Drivers
    should interpret the woke values as arc seconds, with valid values
    between -180 * 3600 and +180 * 3600 inclusive.

``V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    This control sets the woke focal point of the woke camera to the woke specified
    position. The unit is undefined. Positive values set the woke focus
    closer to the woke camera, negative values towards infinity.

``V4L2_CID_FOCUS_RELATIVE (integer)``
    This control moves the woke focal point of the woke camera by the woke specified
    amount. The unit is undefined. Positive values move the woke focus closer
    to the woke camera, negative values towards infinity. This is a
    write-only control.

``V4L2_CID_FOCUS_AUTO (boolean)``
    Enables continuous automatic focus adjustments. The effect of manual
    focus adjustments while this feature is enabled is undefined,
    drivers should ignore such requests.

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_START (button)``
    Starts single auto focus process. The effect of setting this control
    when ``V4L2_CID_FOCUS_AUTO`` is set to ``TRUE`` (1) is undefined,
    drivers should ignore such requests.

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_STOP (button)``
    Aborts automatic focusing started with ``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_START``
    control. It is effective only when the woke continuous autofocus is
    disabled, that is when ``V4L2_CID_FOCUS_AUTO`` control is set to
    ``FALSE`` (0).

.. _v4l2-auto-focus-status:

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS (bitmask)``
    The automatic focus status. This is a read-only control.

    Setting ``V4L2_LOCK_FOCUS`` lock bit of the woke ``V4L2_CID_3A_LOCK``
    control may stop updates of the woke ``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS``
    control value.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.8cm}|p{10.7cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS_IDLE``
      - Automatic focus is not active.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS_BUSY``
      - Automatic focusing is in progress.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS_REACHED``
      - Focus has been reached.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_STATUS_FAILED``
      - Automatic focus has failed, the woke driver will not transition from
	this state until another action is performed by an application.



.. _v4l2-auto-focus-range:

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_FOCUS_RANGE``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_auto_focus_range -
    Determines auto focus distance range for which lens may be adjusted.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.9cm}|p{10.6cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_RANGE_AUTO``
      - The camera automatically selects the woke focus range.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_RANGE_NORMAL``
      - Normal distance range, limited for best automatic focus
	performance.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_RANGE_MACRO``
      - Macro (close-up) auto focus. The camera will use its minimum
	possible distance for auto focus.
    * - ``V4L2_AUTO_FOCUS_RANGE_INFINITY``
      - The lens is set to focus on an object at infinite distance.



``V4L2_CID_ZOOM_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    Specify the woke objective lens focal length as an absolute value. The
    zoom unit is driver-specific and its value should be a positive
    integer.

``V4L2_CID_ZOOM_RELATIVE (integer)``
    Specify the woke objective lens focal length relatively to the woke current
    value. Positive values move the woke zoom lens group towards the
    telephoto direction, negative values towards the woke wide-angle
    direction. The zoom unit is driver-specific. This is a write-only
    control.

``V4L2_CID_ZOOM_CONTINUOUS (integer)``
    Move the woke objective lens group at the woke specified speed until it
    reaches physical device limits or until an explicit request to stop
    the woke movement. A positive value moves the woke zoom lens group towards the
    telephoto direction. A value of zero stops the woke zoom lens group
    movement. A negative value moves the woke zoom lens group towards the
    wide-angle direction. The zoom speed unit is driver-specific.

``V4L2_CID_IRIS_ABSOLUTE (integer)``
    This control sets the woke camera's aperture to the woke specified value. The
    unit is undefined. Larger values open the woke iris wider, smaller values
    close it.

``V4L2_CID_IRIS_RELATIVE (integer)``
    This control modifies the woke camera's aperture by the woke specified amount.
    The unit is undefined. Positive values open the woke iris one step
    further, negative values close it one step further. This is a
    write-only control.

``V4L2_CID_PRIVACY (boolean)``
    Prevent video from being acquired by the woke camera. When this control
    is set to ``TRUE`` (1), no image can be captured by the woke camera.
    Common means to enforce privacy are mechanical obturation of the
    sensor and firmware image processing, but the woke device is not
    restricted to these methods. Devices that implement the woke privacy
    control must support read access and may support write access.

``V4L2_CID_BAND_STOP_FILTER (integer)``
    Switch the woke band-stop filter of a camera sensor on or off, or specify
    its strength. Such band-stop filters can be used, for example, to
    filter out the woke fluorescent light component.

.. _v4l2-auto-n-preset-white-balance:

``V4L2_CID_AUTO_N_PRESET_WHITE_BALANCE``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_auto_n_preset_white_balance -
    Sets white balance to automatic, manual or a preset. The presets
    determine color temperature of the woke light as a hint to the woke camera for
    white balance adjustments resulting in most accurate color
    representation. The following white balance presets are listed in
    order of increasing color temperature.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{7.4cm}|p{10.1cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_MANUAL``
      - Manual white balance.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_AUTO``
      - Automatic white balance adjustments.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_INCANDESCENT``
      - White balance setting for incandescent (tungsten) lighting. It
	generally cools down the woke colors and corresponds approximately to
	2500...3500 K color temperature range.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_FLUORESCENT``
      - White balance preset for fluorescent lighting. It corresponds
	approximately to 4000...5000 K color temperature.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_FLUORESCENT_H``
      - With this setting the woke camera will compensate for fluorescent H
	lighting.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_HORIZON``
      - White balance setting for horizon daylight. It corresponds
	approximately to 5000 K color temperature.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_DAYLIGHT``
      - White balance preset for daylight (with clear sky). It corresponds
	approximately to 5000...6500 K color temperature.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_FLASH``
      - With this setting the woke camera will compensate for the woke flash light.
	It slightly warms up the woke colors and corresponds roughly to
	5000...5500 K color temperature.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_CLOUDY``
      - White balance preset for moderately overcast sky. This option
	corresponds approximately to 6500...8000 K color temperature
	range.
    * - ``V4L2_WHITE_BALANCE_SHADE``
      - White balance preset for shade or heavily overcast sky. It
	corresponds approximately to 9000...10000 K color temperature.



.. _v4l2-wide-dynamic-range:

``V4L2_CID_WIDE_DYNAMIC_RANGE (boolean)``
    Enables or disables the woke camera's wide dynamic range feature. This
    feature allows to obtain clear images in situations where intensity
    of the woke illumination varies significantly throughout the woke scene, i.e.
    there are simultaneously very dark and very bright areas. It is most
    commonly realized in cameras by combining two subsequent frames with
    different exposure times.  [#f1]_

.. _v4l2-image-stabilization:

``V4L2_CID_IMAGE_STABILIZATION (boolean)``
    Enables or disables image stabilization.

``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY (integer menu)``
    Determines ISO equivalent of an image sensor indicating the woke sensor's
    sensitivity to light. The numbers are expressed in arithmetic scale,
    as per :ref:`iso12232` standard, where doubling the woke sensor
    sensitivity is represented by doubling the woke numerical ISO value.
    Applications should interpret the woke values as standard ISO values
    multiplied by 1000, e.g. control value 800 stands for ISO 0.8.
    Drivers will usually support only a subset of standard ISO values.
    The effect of setting this control while the
    ``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY_AUTO`` control is set to a value other
    than ``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY_MANUAL`` is undefined, drivers
    should ignore such requests.

.. _v4l2-iso-sensitivity-auto-type:

``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY_AUTO``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_iso_sensitivity_type -
    Enables or disables automatic ISO sensitivity adjustments.



.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY_MANUAL``
      - Manual ISO sensitivity.
    * - ``V4L2_CID_ISO_SENSITIVITY_AUTO``
      - Automatic ISO sensitivity adjustments.



.. _v4l2-scene-mode:

``V4L2_CID_SCENE_MODE``
    (enum)

enum v4l2_scene_mode -
    This control allows to select scene programs as the woke camera automatic
    modes optimized for common shooting scenes. Within these modes the
    camera determines best exposure, aperture, focusing, light metering,
    white balance and equivalent sensitivity. The controls of those
    parameters are influenced by the woke scene mode control. An exact
    behavior in each mode is subject to the woke camera specification.

    When the woke scene mode feature is not used, this control should be set
    to ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_NONE`` to make sure the woke other possibly related
    controls are accessible. The following scene programs are defined:

.. raw:: latex

    \small

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5.9cm}|p{11.6cm}|

.. cssclass:: longtable

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_NONE``
      - The scene mode feature is disabled.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_BACKLIGHT``
      - Backlight. Compensates for dark shadows when light is coming from
	behind a subject, also by automatically turning on the woke flash.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_BEACH_SNOW``
      - Beach and snow. This mode compensates for all-white or bright
	scenes, which tend to look gray and low contrast, when camera's
	automatic exposure is based on an average scene brightness. To
	compensate, this mode automatically slightly overexposes the
	frames. The white balance may also be adjusted to compensate for
	the fact that reflected snow looks bluish rather than white.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_CANDLELIGHT``
      - Candle light. The camera generally raises the woke ISO sensitivity and
	lowers the woke shutter speed. This mode compensates for relatively
	close subject in the woke scene. The flash is disabled in order to
	preserve the woke ambiance of the woke light.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_DAWN_DUSK``
      - Dawn and dusk. Preserves the woke colors seen in low natural light
	before dusk and after down. The camera may turn off the woke flash, and
	automatically focus at infinity. It will usually boost saturation
	and lower the woke shutter speed.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_FALL_COLORS``
      - Fall colors. Increases saturation and adjusts white balance for
	color enhancement. Pictures of autumn leaves get saturated reds
	and yellows.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_FIREWORKS``
      - Fireworks. Long exposure times are used to capture the woke expanding
	burst of light from a firework. The camera may invoke image
	stabilization.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_LANDSCAPE``
      - Landscape. The camera may choose a small aperture to provide deep
	depth of field and long exposure duration to help capture detail
	in dim light conditions. The focus is fixed at infinity. Suitable
	for distant and wide scenery.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_NIGHT``
      - Night, also known as Night Landscape. Designed for low light
	conditions, it preserves detail in the woke dark areas without blowing
	out bright objects. The camera generally sets itself to a
	medium-to-high ISO sensitivity, with a relatively long exposure
	time, and turns flash off. As such, there will be increased image
	noise and the woke possibility of blurred image.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_PARTY_INDOOR``
      - Party and indoor. Designed to capture indoor scenes that are lit
	by indoor background lighting as well as the woke flash. The camera
	usually increases ISO sensitivity, and adjusts exposure for the
	low light conditions.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_PORTRAIT``
      - Portrait. The camera adjusts the woke aperture so that the woke depth of
	field is reduced, which helps to isolate the woke subject against a
	smooth background. Most cameras recognize the woke presence of faces in
	the scene and focus on them. The color hue is adjusted to enhance
	skin tones. The intensity of the woke flash is often reduced.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_SPORTS``
      - Sports. Significantly increases ISO and uses a fast shutter speed
	to freeze motion of rapidly-moving subjects. Increased image noise
	may be seen in this mode.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_SUNSET``
      - Sunset. Preserves deep hues seen in sunsets and sunrises. It bumps
	up the woke saturation.
    * - ``V4L2_SCENE_MODE_TEXT``
      - Text. It applies extra contrast and sharpness, it is typically a
	black-and-white mode optimized for readability. Automatic focus
	may be switched to close-up mode and this setting may also involve
	some lens-distortion correction.

``V4L2_CID_3A_LOCK (bitmask)``
    This control locks or unlocks the woke automatic focus, exposure and
    white balance. The automatic adjustments can be paused independently
    by setting the woke corresponding lock bit to 1. The camera then retains
    the woke settings until the woke lock bit is cleared. The following lock bits
    are defined:

    When a given algorithm is not enabled, drivers should ignore
    requests to lock it and should return no error. An example might be
    an application setting bit ``V4L2_LOCK_WHITE_BALANCE`` when the
    ``V4L2_CID_AUTO_WHITE_BALANCE`` control is set to ``FALSE``. The
    value of this control may be changed by exposure, white balance or
    focus controls.



.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_LOCK_EXPOSURE``
      - Automatic exposure adjustments lock.
    * - ``V4L2_LOCK_WHITE_BALANCE``
      - Automatic white balance adjustments lock.
    * - ``V4L2_LOCK_FOCUS``
      - Automatic focus lock.



``V4L2_CID_PAN_SPEED (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera horizontally at the woke specific speed.
    The unit is undefined. A positive value moves the woke camera to the
    right (clockwise when viewed from above), a negative value to the
    left. A value of zero stops the woke motion if one is in progress and has
    no effect otherwise.

``V4L2_CID_TILT_SPEED (integer)``
    This control turns the woke camera vertically at the woke specified speed. The
    unit is undefined. A positive value moves the woke camera up, a negative
    value down. A value of zero stops the woke motion if one is in progress
    and has no effect otherwise.

.. _v4l2-camera-sensor-orientation:

``V4L2_CID_CAMERA_ORIENTATION (menu)``
    This read-only control describes the woke camera orientation by reporting its
    mounting position on the woke device where the woke camera is installed. The control
    value is constant and not modifiable by software. This control is
    particularly meaningful for devices which have a well defined orientation,
    such as phones, laptops and portable devices since the woke control is expressed
    as a position relative to the woke device's intended usage orientation. For
    example, a camera installed on the woke user-facing side of a phone, a tablet or
    a laptop device is said to be have ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_FRONT``
    orientation, while a camera installed on the woke opposite side of the woke front one
    is said to be have ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_BACK`` orientation. Camera
    sensors not directly attached to the woke device, or attached in a way that
    allows them to move freely, such as webcams and digital cameras, are said to
    have the woke ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_EXTERNAL`` orientation.

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_FRONT``
      - The camera is oriented towards the woke user facing side of the woke device.
    * - ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_BACK``
      - The camera is oriented towards the woke back facing side of the woke device.
    * - ``V4L2_CAMERA_ORIENTATION_EXTERNAL``
      - The camera is not directly attached to the woke device and is freely movable.


.. _v4l2-camera-sensor-rotation:

``V4L2_CID_CAMERA_SENSOR_ROTATION (integer)``
    This read-only control describes the woke rotation correction in degrees in the
    counter-clockwise direction to be applied to the woke captured images once
    captured to memory to compensate for the woke camera sensor mounting rotation.

    For a precise definition of the woke sensor mounting rotation refer to the
    extensive description of the woke 'rotation' properties in the woke device tree
    bindings file 'video-interfaces.txt'.

    A few examples are below reported, using a shark swimming from left to
    right in front of the woke user as the woke example scene to capture. ::

    Example one - Webcam

    Assuming you can bring your laptop with you while swimming with sharks,
    the woke camera module of the woke laptop is installed on the woke user facing part of a
    laptop screen casing, and is typically used for video calls. The captured
    images are meant to be displayed in landscape mode (width > height) on the
    laptop screen.

    The camera is typically mounted upside-down to compensate the woke lens optical
    inversion effect. In this case the woke value of the
    V4L2_CID_CAMERA_SENSOR_ROTATION control is 0, no rotation is required to
    display images correctly to the woke user.

    If the woke camera sensor is not mounted upside-down it is required to compensate
    the woke lens optical inversion effect and the woke value of the
    V4L2_CID_CAMERA_SENSOR_ROTATION control is 180 degrees, as images will
    result rotated when captured to memory. ::

    Example two - Phone camera

    It is more handy to go and swim with sharks with only your mobile phone
    with you and take pictures with the woke camera that is installed on the woke back
    side of the woke device, facing away from the woke user. The captured images are meant
    to be displayed in portrait mode (height > width) to match the woke device screen
    orientation and the woke device usage orientation used when taking the woke picture.

    The camera sensor is typically mounted with its pixel array longer side
    aligned to the woke device longer side, upside-down mounted to compensate for
    the woke lens optical inversion effect.

    The images once captured to memory will be rotated and the woke value of the
    V4L2_CID_CAMERA_SENSOR_ROTATION will report a 90 degree rotation. ::

.. [#f1]
   This control may be changed to a menu control in the woke future, if more
   options are required.

``V4L2_CID_HDR_SENSOR_MODE (menu)``
    Change the woke sensor HDR mode. A HDR picture is obtained by merging two
    captures of the woke same scene using two different exposure periods. HDR mode
    describes the woke way these two captures are merged in the woke sensor.

    As modes differ for each sensor, menu items are not standardized by this
    control and are left to the woke programmer.
