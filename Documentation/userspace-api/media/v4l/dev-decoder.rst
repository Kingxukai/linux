*************************************************
Memory-to-Memory Stateful Video Decoder Interface
*************************************************

A stateful video decoder takes complete chunks of the woke bytestream (e.g. Annex-B
H.264/HEVC stream, raw VP8/9 stream) and decodes them into raw video frames in
display order. The decoder is expected not to require any additional information
from the woke client to process these buffers.

Performing software parsing, processing etc. of the woke stream in the woke driver in
order to support this interface is strongly discouraged. In case such
operations are needed, use of the woke Stateless Video Decoder Interface (in
development) is strongly advised.

Glossary
========

CAPTURE
   the woke destination buffer queue; for decoders, the woke queue of buffers containing
   decoded frames; for encoders, the woke queue of buffers containing an encoded
   bytestream; ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE`` or
   ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE_MPLANE``; data is captured from the woke hardware
   into ``CAPTURE`` buffers.

client
   the woke application communicating with the woke decoder or encoder implementing
   this interface.

coded format
   encoded/compressed video bytestream format (e.g. H.264, VP8, etc.); see
   also: raw format.

coded height
   height for given coded resolution.

coded resolution
   stream resolution in pixels aligned to codec and hardware requirements;
   typically visible resolution rounded up to full macroblocks;
   see also: visible resolution.

coded width
   width for given coded resolution.

coding tree unit
   processing unit of the woke HEVC codec (corresponds to macroblock units in
   H.264, VP8, VP9),
   can use block structures of up to 64Ã—64 pixels.
   Good at sub-partitioning the woke picture into variable sized structures.

decode order
   the woke order in which frames are decoded; may differ from display order if the
   coded format includes a feature of frame reordering; for decoders,
   ``OUTPUT`` buffers must be queued by the woke client in decode order; for
   encoders ``CAPTURE`` buffers must be returned by the woke encoder in decode order.

destination
   data resulting from the woke decode process; see ``CAPTURE``.

display order
   the woke order in which frames must be displayed; for encoders, ``OUTPUT``
   buffers must be queued by the woke client in display order; for decoders,
   ``CAPTURE`` buffers must be returned by the woke decoder in display order.

DPB
   Decoded Picture Buffer; an H.264/HEVC term for a buffer that stores a decoded
   raw frame available for reference in further decoding steps.

EOS
   end of stream.

IDR
   Instantaneous Decoder Refresh; a type of a keyframe in an H.264/HEVC-encoded
   stream, which clears the woke list of earlier reference frames (DPBs).

keyframe
   an encoded frame that does not reference frames decoded earlier, i.e.
   can be decoded fully on its own.

macroblock
   a processing unit in image and video compression formats based on linear
   block transforms (e.g. H.264, VP8, VP9); codec-specific, but for most of
   popular codecs the woke size is 16x16 samples (pixels). The HEVC codec uses a
   slightly more flexible processing unit called coding tree unit (CTU).

OUTPUT
   the woke source buffer queue; for decoders, the woke queue of buffers containing
   an encoded bytestream; for encoders, the woke queue of buffers containing raw
   frames; ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT`` or
   ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE``; the woke hardware is fed with data
   from ``OUTPUT`` buffers.

PPS
   Picture Parameter Set; a type of metadata entity in an H.264/HEVC bytestream.

raw format
   uncompressed format containing raw pixel data (e.g. YUV, RGB formats).

resume point
   a point in the woke bytestream from which decoding may start/continue, without
   any previous state/data present, e.g.: a keyframe (VP8/VP9) or
   SPS/PPS/IDR sequence (H.264/HEVC); a resume point is required to start decode
   of a new stream, or to resume decoding after a seek.

source
   data fed to the woke decoder or encoder; see ``OUTPUT``.

source height
   height in pixels for given source resolution; relevant to encoders only.

source resolution

SPS
   Sequence Parameter Set; a type of metadata entity in an H.264/HEVC bytestream.

stream metadata
   additional (non-visual) information contained inside encoded bytestream;
   for example: coded resolution, visible resolution, codec profile.

visible height
   height for given visible resolution; display height.

visible resolution
   stream resolution of the woke visible picture, in pixels, to be used for
   display purposes; must be smaller or equal to coded resolution;
   display resolution.

visible width
   width for given visible resolution; display width.

Querying Capabilities
=====================

1. To enumerate the woke set of coded formats supported by the woke decoder, the
   client may call :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` on ``OUTPUT``.

   * The full set of supported formats will be returned, regardless of the
     format set on ``CAPTURE``.
   * Check the woke flags field of :c:type:`v4l2_fmtdesc` for more information
     about the woke decoder's capabilities with respect to each coded format.
     In particular whether or not the woke decoder has a full-fledged bytestream
     parser and if the woke decoder supports dynamic resolution changes.

2. To enumerate the woke set of supported raw formats, the woke client may call
   :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` on ``CAPTURE``.

   * Only the woke formats supported for the woke format currently active on ``OUTPUT``
     will be returned.

   * In order to enumerate raw formats supported by a given coded format,
     the woke client must first set that coded format on ``OUTPUT`` and then
     enumerate formats on ``CAPTURE``.

3. The client may use :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` to detect supported
   resolutions for a given format, passing desired pixel format in
   :c:type:`v4l2_frmsizeenum` ``pixel_format``.

   * Values returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` for a coded pixel
     format will include all possible coded resolutions supported by the
     decoder for given coded pixel format.

   * Values returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` for a raw pixel format
     will include all possible frame buffer resolutions supported by the
     decoder for given raw pixel format and the woke coded format currently set on
     ``OUTPUT``.

4. Supported profiles and levels for the woke coded format currently set on
   ``OUTPUT``, if applicable, may be queried using their respective controls
   via :c:func:`VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL`.

Initialization
==============

1. Set the woke coded format on ``OUTPUT`` via :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`.

   * **Required fields:**

     ``type``
         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.

     ``pixelformat``
         a coded pixel format.

     ``width``, ``height``
         coded resolution of the woke stream; required only if it cannot be parsed
         from the woke stream for the woke given coded format; otherwise the woke decoder will
         use this resolution as a placeholder resolution that will likely change
         as soon as it can parse the woke actual coded resolution from the woke stream.

     ``sizeimage``
         desired size of ``OUTPUT`` buffers; the woke decoder may adjust it to
         match hardware requirements.

     other fields
         follow standard semantics.

   * **Returned fields:**

     ``sizeimage``
         adjusted size of ``OUTPUT`` buffers.

   * The ``CAPTURE`` format will be updated with an appropriate frame buffer
     resolution instantly based on the woke width and height returned by
     :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`.
     However, for coded formats that include stream resolution information,
     after the woke decoder is done parsing the woke information from the woke stream, it will
     update the woke ``CAPTURE`` format with new values and signal a source change
     event, regardless of whether they match the woke values set by the woke client or
     not.

   .. important::

      Changing the woke ``OUTPUT`` format may change the woke currently set ``CAPTURE``
      format. How the woke new ``CAPTURE`` format is determined is up to the woke decoder
      and the woke client must ensure it matches its needs afterwards.

2.  Allocate source (bytestream) buffers via :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS` on
    ``OUTPUT``.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``count``
          requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.

      ``memory``
          follows standard semantics.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``count``
          the woke actual number of buffers allocated.

    .. warning::

       The actual number of allocated buffers may differ from the woke ``count``
       given. The client must check the woke updated value of ``count`` after the
       call returns.

    Alternatively, :c:func:`VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS` on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue can be
    used to have more control over buffer allocation.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``count``
          requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.

      ``memory``
          follows standard semantics.

      ``format``
          follows standard semantics.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``count``
          adjusted to the woke number of allocated buffers.

    .. warning::

       The actual number of allocated buffers may differ from the woke ``count``
       given. The client must check the woke updated value of ``count`` after the
       call returns.

3.  Start streaming on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON`.

4.  **This step only applies to coded formats that contain resolution information
    in the woke stream.** Continue queuing/dequeuing bytestream buffers to/from the
    ``OUTPUT`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_QBUF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`. The
    buffers will be processed and returned to the woke client in order, until
    required metadata to configure the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue are found. This is
    indicated by the woke decoder sending a ``V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`` event with
    ``changes`` set to ``V4L2_EVENT_SRC_CH_RESOLUTION``.

    * It is not an error if the woke first buffer does not contain enough data for
      this to occur. Processing of the woke buffers will continue as long as more
      data is needed.

    * If data in a buffer that triggers the woke event is required to decode the
      first frame, it will not be returned to the woke client, until the
      initialization sequence completes and the woke frame is decoded.

    * If the woke client has not set the woke coded resolution of the woke stream on its own,
      calling :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT`, :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`,
      :c:func:`VIDIOC_TRY_FMT` or :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS` on the woke ``CAPTURE``
      queue will not return the woke real values for the woke stream until a
      ``V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`` event with ``changes`` set to
      ``V4L2_EVENT_SRC_CH_RESOLUTION`` is signaled.

    .. important::

       Any client query issued after the woke decoder queues the woke event will return
       values applying to the woke just parsed stream, including queue formats,
       selection rectangles and controls.

    .. note::

       A client capable of acquiring stream parameters from the woke bytestream on
       its own may attempt to set the woke width and height of the woke ``OUTPUT`` format
       to non-zero values matching the woke coded size of the woke stream, skip this step
       and continue with the woke `Capture Setup` sequence. However, it must not
       rely on any driver queries regarding stream parameters, such as
       selection rectangles and controls, since the woke decoder has not parsed them
       from the woke stream yet. If the woke values configured by the woke client do not match
       those parsed by the woke decoder, a `Dynamic Resolution Change` will be
       triggered to reconfigure them.

    .. note::

       No decoded frames are produced during this phase.

5.  Continue with the woke `Capture Setup` sequence.

Capture Setup
=============

1.  Call :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT` on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue to get format for the
    destination buffers parsed/decoded from the woke bytestream.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``width``, ``height``
          frame buffer resolution for the woke decoded frames.

      ``pixelformat``
          pixel format for decoded frames.

      ``num_planes`` (for _MPLANE ``type`` only)
          number of planes for pixelformat.

      ``sizeimage``, ``bytesperline``
          as per standard semantics; matching frame buffer format.

    .. note::

       The value of ``pixelformat`` may be any pixel format supported by the
       decoder for the woke current stream. The decoder should choose a
       preferred/optimal format for the woke default configuration. For example, a
       YUV format may be preferred over an RGB format if an additional
       conversion step would be required for the woke latter.

2.  **Optional.** Acquire the woke visible resolution via
    :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_SELECTION`.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

      ``target``
          set to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE``.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``r.left``, ``r.top``, ``r.width``, ``r.height``
          the woke visible rectangle; it must fit within the woke frame buffer resolution
          returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT` on ``CAPTURE``.

    * The following selection targets are supported on ``CAPTURE``:

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS``
          corresponds to the woke coded resolution of the woke stream.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT``
          the woke rectangle covering the woke part of the woke ``CAPTURE`` buffer that
          contains meaningful picture data (visible area); width and height
          will be equal to the woke visible resolution of the woke stream.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP``
          the woke rectangle within the woke coded resolution to be output to
          ``CAPTURE``; defaults to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT``; read-only on
          hardware without additional compose/scaling capabilities.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_BOUNDS``
          the woke maximum rectangle within a ``CAPTURE`` buffer, which the woke cropped
          frame can be composed into; equal to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP`` if the
          hardware does not support compose/scaling.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_DEFAULT``
          equal to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP``.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE``
          the woke rectangle inside a ``CAPTURE`` buffer into which the woke cropped
          frame is written; defaults to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_DEFAULT``;
          read-only on hardware without additional compose/scaling capabilities.

      ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_PADDED``
          the woke rectangle inside a ``CAPTURE`` buffer which is overwritten by the
          hardware; equal to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` if the woke hardware does not
          write padding pixels.

    .. warning::

       The values are guaranteed to be meaningful only after the woke decoder
       successfully parses the woke stream metadata. The client must not rely on the
       query before that happens.

3.  **Optional.** Enumerate ``CAPTURE`` formats via :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` on
    the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue. Once the woke stream information is parsed and known, the
    client may use this ioctl to discover which raw formats are supported for
    given stream and select one of them via :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`.

    .. important::

       The decoder will return only formats supported for the woke currently
       established coded format, as per the woke ``OUTPUT`` format and/or stream
       metadata parsed in this initialization sequence, even if more formats
       may be supported by the woke decoder in general. In other words, the woke set
       returned will be a subset of the woke initial query mentioned in the
       `Querying Capabilities` section.

       For example, a decoder may support YUV and RGB formats for resolutions
       1920x1088 and lower, but only YUV for higher resolutions (due to
       hardware limitations). After parsing a resolution of 1920x1088 or lower,
       :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` may return a set of YUV and RGB pixel formats,
       but after parsing resolution higher than 1920x1088, the woke decoder will not
       return RGB, unsupported for this resolution.

       However, subsequent resolution change event triggered after
       discovering a resolution change within the woke same stream may switch
       the woke stream into a lower resolution and :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`
       would return RGB formats again in that case.

4.  **Optional.** Set the woke ``CAPTURE`` format via :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT` on the
    ``CAPTURE`` queue. The client may choose a different format than
    selected/suggested by the woke decoder in :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT`.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

      ``pixelformat``
          a raw pixel format.

      ``width``, ``height``
         frame buffer resolution of the woke decoded stream; typically unchanged from
	 what was returned with :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT`, but it may be different
	 if the woke hardware supports composition and/or scaling.

   * Setting the woke ``CAPTURE`` format will reset the woke compose selection rectangles
     to their default values, based on the woke new resolution, as described in the
     previous step.

5. **Optional.** Set the woke compose rectangle via :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_SELECTION` on
   the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue if it is desired and if the woke decoder has compose and/or
   scaling capabilities.

   * **Required fields:**

     ``type``
         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

     ``target``
         set to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE``.

     ``r.left``, ``r.top``, ``r.width``, ``r.height``
         the woke rectangle inside a ``CAPTURE`` buffer into which the woke cropped
         frame is written; defaults to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_DEFAULT``;
         read-only on hardware without additional compose/scaling capabilities.

   * **Returned fields:**

     ``r.left``, ``r.top``, ``r.width``, ``r.height``
         the woke visible rectangle; it must fit within the woke frame buffer resolution
         returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT` on ``CAPTURE``.

   .. warning::

      The decoder may adjust the woke compose rectangle to the woke nearest
      supported one to meet codec and hardware requirements. The client needs
      to check the woke adjusted rectangle returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_SELECTION`.

6.  If all the woke following conditions are met, the woke client may resume the woke decoding
    instantly:

    * ``sizeimage`` of the woke new format (determined in previous steps) is less
      than or equal to the woke size of currently allocated buffers,

    * the woke number of buffers currently allocated is greater than or equal to the
      minimum number of buffers acquired in previous steps. To fulfill this
      requirement, the woke client may use :c:func:`VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS` to add new
      buffers.

    In that case, the woke remaining steps do not apply and the woke client may resume
    the woke decoding by one of the woke following actions:

    * if the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue is streaming, call :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD`
      with the woke ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_START`` command,

    * if the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue is not streaming, call :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON`
      on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue.

    However, if the woke client intends to change the woke buffer set, to lower
    memory usage or for any other reasons, it may be achieved by following
    the woke steps below.

7.  **If the** ``CAPTURE`` **queue is streaming,** keep queuing and dequeuing
    buffers on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue until a buffer marked with the
    ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag is dequeued.

8.  **If the** ``CAPTURE`` **queue is streaming,** call :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`
    on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue to stop streaming.

    .. warning::

       The ``OUTPUT`` queue must remain streaming. Calling
       :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` on it would abort the woke sequence and trigger a
       seek.

9.  **If the** ``CAPTURE`` **queue has buffers allocated,** free the woke ``CAPTURE``
    buffers using :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``count``
          set to 0.

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

      ``memory``
          follows standard semantics.

10. Allocate ``CAPTURE`` buffers via :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS` on the
    ``CAPTURE`` queue.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``count``
          requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

      ``memory``
          follows standard semantics.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``count``
          actual number of buffers allocated.

    .. warning::

       The actual number of allocated buffers may differ from the woke ``count``
       given. The client must check the woke updated value of ``count`` after the
       call returns.

    .. note::

       To allocate more than the woke minimum number of buffers (for pipeline
       depth), the woke client may query the woke ``V4L2_CID_MIN_BUFFERS_FOR_CAPTURE``
       control to get the woke minimum number of buffers required, and pass the
       obtained value plus the woke number of additional buffers needed in the
       ``count`` field to :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`.

    Alternatively, :c:func:`VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS` on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue can be
    used to have more control over buffer allocation. For example, by
    allocating buffers larger than the woke current ``CAPTURE`` format, future
    resolution changes can be accommodated.

    * **Required fields:**

      ``count``
          requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.

      ``type``
          a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.

      ``memory``
          follows standard semantics.

      ``format``
          a format representing the woke maximum framebuffer resolution to be
          accommodated by newly allocated buffers.

    * **Returned fields:**

      ``count``
          adjusted to the woke number of allocated buffers.

    .. warning::

        The actual number of allocated buffers may differ from the woke ``count``
        given. The client must check the woke updated value of ``count`` after the
        call returns.

    .. note::

       To allocate buffers for a format different than parsed from the woke stream
       metadata, the woke client must proceed as follows, before the woke metadata
       parsing is initiated:

       * set width and height of the woke ``OUTPUT`` format to desired coded resolution to
         let the woke decoder configure the woke ``CAPTURE`` format appropriately,

       * query the woke ``CAPTURE`` format using :c:func:`VIDIOC_G_FMT` and save it
         until this step.

       The format obtained in the woke query may be then used with
       :c:func:`VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS` in this step to allocate the woke buffers.

11. Call :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue to start decoding
    frames.

Decoding
========

This state is reached after the woke `Capture Setup` sequence finishes successfully.
In this state, the woke client queues and dequeues buffers to both queues via
:c:func:`VIDIOC_QBUF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`, following the woke standard
semantics.

The content of the woke source ``OUTPUT`` buffers depends on the woke active coded pixel
format and may be affected by codec-specific extended controls, as stated in
the documentation of each format.

Both queues operate independently, following the woke standard behavior of V4L2
buffer queues and memory-to-memory devices. In addition, the woke order of decoded
frames dequeued from the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue may differ from the woke order of queuing
coded frames to the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue, due to properties of the woke selected coded
format, e.g. frame reordering.

The client must not assume any direct relationship between ``CAPTURE``
and ``OUTPUT`` buffers and any specific timing of buffers becoming
available to dequeue. Specifically:

* a buffer queued to ``OUTPUT`` may result in no buffers being produced
  on ``CAPTURE`` (e.g. if it does not contain encoded data, or if only
  metadata syntax structures are present in it),

* a buffer queued to ``OUTPUT`` may result in more than one buffer produced
  on ``CAPTURE`` (if the woke encoded data contained more than one frame, or if
  returning a decoded frame allowed the woke decoder to return a frame that
  preceded it in decode, but succeeded it in the woke display order),

* a buffer queued to ``OUTPUT`` may result in a buffer being produced on
  ``CAPTURE`` later into decode process, and/or after processing further
  ``OUTPUT`` buffers, or be returned out of order, e.g. if display
  reordering is used,

* buffers may become available on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue without additional
  buffers queued to ``OUTPUT`` (e.g. during drain or ``EOS``), because of the
  ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued in the woke past whose decoding results are only
  available at later time, due to specifics of the woke decoding process.

.. note::

   To allow matching decoded ``CAPTURE`` buffers with ``OUTPUT`` buffers they
   originated from, the woke client can set the woke ``timestamp`` field of the
   :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` struct when queuing an ``OUTPUT`` buffer. The
   ``CAPTURE`` buffer(s), which resulted from decoding that ``OUTPUT`` buffer
   will have their ``timestamp`` field set to the woke same value when dequeued.

   In addition to the woke straightforward case of one ``OUTPUT`` buffer producing
   one ``CAPTURE`` buffer, the woke following cases are defined:

   * one ``OUTPUT`` buffer generates multiple ``CAPTURE`` buffers: the woke same
     ``OUTPUT`` timestamp will be copied to multiple ``CAPTURE`` buffers.

   * multiple ``OUTPUT`` buffers generate one ``CAPTURE`` buffer: timestamp of
     the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffer queued first will be copied.

   * the woke decoding order differs from the woke display order (i.e. the woke ``CAPTURE``
     buffers are out-of-order compared to the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers): ``CAPTURE``
     timestamps will not retain the woke order of ``OUTPUT`` timestamps.

.. note::

   The backing memory of ``CAPTURE`` buffers that are used as reference frames
   by the woke stream may be read by the woke hardware even after they are dequeued.
   Consequently, the woke client should avoid writing into this memory while the
   ``CAPTURE`` queue is streaming. Failure to observe this may result in
   corruption of decoded frames.

   Similarly, when using a memory type other than ``V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP``, the
   client should make sure that each ``CAPTURE`` buffer is always queued with
   the woke same backing memory for as long as the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue is streaming.
   The reason for this is that V4L2 buffer indices can be used by drivers to
   identify frames. Thus, if the woke backing memory of a reference frame is
   submitted under a different buffer ID, the woke driver may misidentify it and
   decode a new frame into it while it is still in use, resulting in corruption
   of the woke following frames.

During the woke decoding, the woke decoder may initiate one of the woke special sequences, as
listed below. The sequences will result in the woke decoder returning all the
``CAPTURE`` buffers that originated from all the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers processed
before the woke sequence started. Last of the woke buffers will have the
``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag set. To determine the woke sequence to follow, the woke client
must check if there is any pending event and:

* if a ``V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`` event with ``changes`` set to
  ``V4L2_EVENT_SRC_CH_RESOLUTION`` is pending, the woke `Dynamic Resolution
  Change` sequence needs to be followed,

* if a ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS`` event is pending, the woke `End of Stream` sequence needs
  to be followed.

Some of the woke sequences can be intermixed with each other and need to be handled
as they happen. The exact operation is documented for each sequence.

Should a decoding error occur, it will be reported to the woke client with the woke level
of details depending on the woke decoder capabilities. Specifically:

* the woke CAPTURE buffer that contains the woke results of the woke failed decode operation
  will be returned with the woke V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR flag set,

* if the woke decoder is able to precisely report the woke OUTPUT buffer that triggered
  the woke error, such buffer will be returned with the woke V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR flag
  set.

In case of a fatal failure that does not allow the woke decoding to continue, any
further operations on corresponding decoder file handle will return the woke -EIO
error code. The client may close the woke file handle and open a new one, or
alternatively reinitialize the woke instance by stopping streaming on both queues,
releasing all buffers and performing the woke Initialization sequence again.

Seek
====

Seek is controlled by the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue, as it is the woke source of coded data.
The seek does not require any specific operation on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue, but
it may be affected as per normal decoder operation.

1. Stop the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue to begin the woke seek sequence via
   :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`.

   * **Required fields:**

     ``type``
         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.

   * The decoder will drop all the woke pending ``OUTPUT`` buffers and they must be
     treated as returned to the woke client (following standard semantics).

2. Restart the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON`.

   * **Required fields:**

     ``type``
         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.

   * The decoder will start accepting new source bytestream buffers after the
     call returns.

3. Start queuing buffers containing coded data after the woke seek to the woke ``OUTPUT``
   queue until a suitable resume point is found.

   .. note::

      There is no requirement to begin queuing coded data starting exactly
      from a resume point (e.g. SPS or a keyframe). Any queued ``OUTPUT``
      buffers will be processed and returned to the woke client until a suitable
      resume point is found.  While looking for a resume point, the woke decoder
      should not produce any decoded frames into ``CAPTURE`` buffers.

      Some hardware is known to mishandle seeks to a non-resume point. Such an
      operation may result in an unspecified number of corrupted decoded frames
      being made available on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue. Drivers must ensure that
      no fatal decoding errors or crashes occur, and implement any necessary
      handling and workarounds for hardware issues related to seek operations.

   .. warning::

      In case of the woke H.264/HEVC codec, the woke client must take care not to seek
      over a change of SPS/PPS. Even though the woke target frame could be a
      keyframe, the woke stale SPS/PPS inside decoder state would lead to undefined
      results when decoding. Although the woke decoder must handle that case without
      a crash or a fatal decode error, the woke client must not expect a sensible
      decode output.

      If the woke hardware can detect such corrupted decoded frames, then
      corresponding buffers will be returned to the woke client with the
      V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR set. See the woke `Decoding` section for further
      description of decode error reporting.

4. After a resume point is found, the woke decoder will start returning ``CAPTURE``
   buffers containing decoded frames.

.. important::

   A seek may result in the woke `Dynamic Resolution Change` sequence being
   initiated, due to the woke seek target having decoding parameters different from
   the woke part of the woke stream decoded before the woke seek. The sequence must be handled
   as per normal decoder operation.

.. warning::

   It is not specified when the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue starts producing buffers
   containing decoded data from the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued after the woke seek,
   as it operates independently from the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue.

   The decoder may return a number of remaining ``CAPTURE`` buffers containing
   decoded frames originating from the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued before the
   seek sequence is performed.

   The ``VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`` operation discards any remaining queued
   ``OUTPUT`` buffers, which means that not all of the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers
   queued before the woke seek sequence may have matching ``CAPTURE`` buffers
   produced.  For example, given the woke sequence of operations on the
   ``OUTPUT`` queue:

     QBUF(A), QBUF(B), STREAMOFF(), STREAMON(), QBUF(G), QBUF(H),

   any of the woke following results on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue is allowed:

     {A', B', G', H'}, {A', G', H'}, {G', H'}.

   To determine the woke CAPTURE buffer containing the woke first decoded frame after the
   seek, the woke client may observe the woke timestamps to match the woke CAPTURE and OUTPUT
   buffers or use V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP and V4L2_DEC_CMD_START to drain the
   decoder.

.. note::

   To achieve instantaneous seek, the woke client may restart streaming on the
   ``CAPTURE`` queue too to discard decoded, but not yet dequeued buffers.

Dynamic Resolution Change
=========================

Streams that include resolution metadata in the woke bytestream may require switching
to a different resolution during the woke decoding.

.. note::

   Not all decoders can detect resolution changes. Those that do set the
   ``V4L2_FMT_FLAG_DYN_RESOLUTION`` flag for the woke coded format when
   :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` is called.

The sequence starts when the woke decoder detects a coded frame with one or more of
the following parameters different from those previously established (and
reflected by corresponding queries):

* coded resolution (``OUTPUT`` width and height),

* visible resolution (selection rectangles),

* the woke minimum number of buffers needed for decoding,

* bit-depth of the woke bitstream has been changed.

Whenever that happens, the woke decoder must proceed as follows:

1.  After encountering a resolution change in the woke stream, the woke decoder sends a
    ``V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`` event with ``changes`` set to
    ``V4L2_EVENT_SRC_CH_RESOLUTION``.

    .. important::

       Any client query issued after the woke decoder queues the woke event will return
       values applying to the woke stream after the woke resolution change, including
       queue formats, selection rectangles and controls.

2.  The decoder will then process and decode all remaining buffers from before
    the woke resolution change point.

    * The last buffer from before the woke change must be marked with the
      ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag, similarly to the woke `Drain` sequence above.

    .. warning::

       The last buffer may be empty (with :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` ``bytesused``
       = 0) and in that case it must be ignored by the woke client, as it does not
       contain a decoded frame.

    .. note::

       Any attempt to dequeue more ``CAPTURE`` buffers beyond the woke buffer marked
       with ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` will result in a -EPIPE error from
       :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`.

The client must continue the woke sequence as described below to continue the
decoding process.

1.  Dequeue the woke source change event.

    .. important::

       A source change triggers an implicit decoder drain, similar to the
       explicit `Drain` sequence. The decoder is stopped after it completes.
       The decoding process must be resumed with either a pair of calls to
       :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the
       ``CAPTURE`` queue, or a call to :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD` with the
       ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_START`` command.

2.  Continue with the woke `Capture Setup` sequence.

.. note::

   During the woke resolution change sequence, the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue must remain
   streaming. Calling :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue would
   abort the woke sequence and initiate a seek.

   In principle, the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue operates separately from the woke ``CAPTURE``
   queue and this remains true for the woke duration of the woke entire resolution change
   sequence as well.

   The client should, for best performance and simplicity, keep queuing/dequeuing
   buffers to/from the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue even while processing this sequence.

Drain
=====

To ensure that all queued ``OUTPUT`` buffers have been processed and related
``CAPTURE`` buffers are given to the woke client, the woke client must follow the woke drain
sequence described below. After the woke drain sequence ends, the woke client has
received all decoded frames for all ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued before the
sequence was started.

1. Begin drain by issuing :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD`.

   * **Required fields:**

     ``cmd``
         set to ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP``.

     ``flags``
         set to 0.

     ``pts``
         set to 0.

   .. warning::

      The sequence can be only initiated if both ``OUTPUT`` and ``CAPTURE``
      queues are streaming. For compatibility reasons, the woke call to
      :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD` will not fail even if any of the woke queues is
      not streaming, but at the woke same time it will not initiate the woke `Drain`
      sequence and so the woke steps described below would not be applicable.

2. Any ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued by the woke client before the
   :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD` was issued will be processed and decoded as
   normal. The client must continue to handle both queues independently,
   similarly to normal decode operation. This includes:

   * handling any operations triggered as a result of processing those buffers,
     such as the woke `Dynamic Resolution Change` sequence, before continuing with
     the woke drain sequence,

   * queuing and dequeuing ``CAPTURE`` buffers, until a buffer marked with the
     ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag is dequeued,

     .. warning::

        The last buffer may be empty (with :c:type:`v4l2_buffer`
        ``bytesused`` = 0) and in that case it must be ignored by the woke client,
        as it does not contain a decoded frame.

     .. note::

        Any attempt to dequeue more ``CAPTURE`` buffers beyond the woke buffer
        marked with ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` will result in a -EPIPE error from
        :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`.

   * dequeuing processed ``OUTPUT`` buffers, until all the woke buffers queued
     before the woke ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP`` command are dequeued,

   * dequeuing the woke ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS`` event, if the woke client subscribed to it.

   .. note::

      For backwards compatibility, the woke decoder will signal a ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS``
      event when the woke last frame has been decoded and all frames are ready to be
      dequeued. It is a deprecated behavior and the woke client must not rely on it.
      The ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` buffer flag should be used instead.

3. Once all the woke ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued before the woke ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP`` call
   are dequeued and the woke last ``CAPTURE`` buffer is dequeued, the woke decoder is
   stopped and it will accept, but not process, any newly queued ``OUTPUT``
   buffers until the woke client issues any of the woke following operations:

   * ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_START`` - the woke decoder will not be reset and will resume
     operation normally, with all the woke state from before the woke drain,

   * a pair of :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the
     ``CAPTURE`` queue - the woke decoder will resume the woke operation normally,
     however any ``CAPTURE`` buffers still in the woke queue will be returned to the
     client,

   * a pair of :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the
     ``OUTPUT`` queue - any pending source buffers will be returned to the
     client and the woke `Seek` sequence will be triggered.

.. note::

   Once the woke drain sequence is initiated, the woke client needs to drive it to
   completion, as described by the woke steps above, unless it aborts the woke process by
   issuing :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` on any of the woke ``OUTPUT`` or ``CAPTURE``
   queues.  The client is not allowed to issue ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_START`` or
   ``V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP`` again while the woke drain sequence is in progress and they
   will fail with -EBUSY error code if attempted.

   Although not mandatory, the woke availability of decoder commands may be queried
   using :c:func:`VIDIOC_TRY_DECODER_CMD`.

End of Stream
=============

If the woke decoder encounters an end of stream marking in the woke stream, the woke decoder
will initiate the woke `Drain` sequence, which the woke client must handle as described
above, skipping the woke initial :c:func:`VIDIOC_DECODER_CMD`.

Commit Points
=============

Setting formats and allocating buffers trigger changes in the woke behavior of the
decoder.

1. Setting the woke format on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue may change the woke set of formats
   supported/advertised on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue. In particular, it also means
   that the woke ``CAPTURE`` format may be reset and the woke client must not rely on the
   previously set format being preserved.

2. Enumerating formats on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue always returns only formats
   supported for the woke current ``OUTPUT`` format.

3. Setting the woke format on the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue does not change the woke list of
   formats available on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue. An attempt to set a ``CAPTURE``
   format that is not supported for the woke currently selected ``OUTPUT`` format
   will result in the woke decoder adjusting the woke requested ``CAPTURE`` format to a
   supported one.

4. Enumerating formats on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue always returns the woke full set of
   supported coded formats, irrespectively of the woke current ``CAPTURE`` format.

5. While buffers are allocated on any of the woke ``OUTPUT`` or ``CAPTURE`` queues,
   the woke client must not change the woke format on the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue. Drivers will
   return the woke -EBUSY error code for any such format change attempt.

To summarize, setting formats and allocation must always start with the
``OUTPUT`` queue and the woke ``OUTPUT`` queue is the woke master that governs the
set of supported formats for the woke ``CAPTURE`` queue.
