These formats store the woke color information of the woke image
in a geometrical representation. The colors are mapped into a
cylinder, where the woke angle is the woke HUE, the woke height is the woke VALUE
and the woke distance to the woke center is the woke SATURATION. This is a very
useful format for image segmentation algorithms.
