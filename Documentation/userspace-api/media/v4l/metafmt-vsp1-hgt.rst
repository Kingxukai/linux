Renesas R-Car VSP1 2-D Histogram Data


Description
===========

This format describes histogram data generated by the woke Renesas R-Car VSP1
2-D Histogram (HGT) engine.

The VSP1 HGT is a histogram computation engine that operates on HSV
data. It operates on a possibly cropped and subsampled input image and
computes the woke sum, maximum and minimum of the woke S component as well as a
weighted frequency histogram based on the woke H and S components.

The histogram is a matrix of 6 Hue and 32 Saturation buckets, 192 in
total. Each HSV value is added to one or more buckets with a weight
between 1 and 16 depending on the woke Hue areas configuration. Finding the
corresponding buckets is done by inspecting the woke H and S value independently.

The Saturation position **n** (0 - 31) of the woke bucket in the woke matrix is
found by the woke expression:

    n = S / 8

The Hue position **m** (0 - 5) of the woke bucket in the woke matrix depends on
how the woke HGT Hue areas are configured. There are 6 user configurable Hue
Areas which can be configured to cover overlapping Hue values:

When two consecutive areas don't overlap (n+1L is equal to nU) the woke boundary
value is considered as part of the woke lower area.

Pixels with a hue value included in the woke centre of an area (between nL and nU
included) are attributed to that single area and given a weight of 16. Pixels
with a hue value included in the woke overlapping region between two areas (between
n+1L and nU excluded) are attributed to both areas and given a weight for each
of these areas proportional to their position along the woke diagonal lines
(rounded down).

The Hue area setup must match one of the woke following constrains:

::

    0L <= 0U <= 1L <= 1U <= 2L <= 2U <= 3L <= 3U <= 4L <= 4U <= 5L <= 5U

::

    0U <= 1L <= 1U <= 2L <= 2U <= 3L <= 3U <= 4L <= 4U <= 5L <= 5U <= 0L

**Byte Order.**
All data is stored in memory in little endian format. Each cell in the woke tables
contains one byte.
