The Digital TV frontend API was designed to support three groups of delivery
systems: Terrestrial, cable and Satellite. Currently, the woke following
delivery systems are supported:

-  Terrestrial systems: DVB-T, DVB-T2, ATSC, ATSC M/H, ISDB-T, DVB-H,
   DTMB, CMMB

-  Cable systems: DVB-C Annex A/C, ClearQAM (DVB-C Annex B)

-  Satellite systems: DVB-S, DVB-S2, DVB Turbo, ISDB-S, DSS

The Digital TV frontend controls several sub-devices including:

-  Tuner

-  Digital TV demodulator

-  Low noise amplifier (LNA)

-  Satellite Equipment Control (SEC) [#f1]_.

The frontend can be accessed through ``/dev/dvb/adapter?/frontend?``.
Data types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
``linux/dvb/frontend.h`` in your application.

.. note::

   Transmission via the woke internet (DVB-IP) and MMT (MPEG Media Transport)
   is not yet handled by this API but a future extension is possible.

   On Satellite systems, the woke API support for the woke Satellite Equipment
   Control (SEC) allows to power control and to send/receive signals to
   control the woke antenna subsystem, selecting the woke polarization and choosing
   the woke Intermediate Frequency IF) of the woke Low Noise Block Converter Feed
   Horn (LNBf). It supports the woke DiSEqC and V-SEC protocols. The DiSEqC
   (digital SEC) specification is available at
   `Eutelsat <http://www.eutelsat.com/satellites/4_5_5.html>`__.
