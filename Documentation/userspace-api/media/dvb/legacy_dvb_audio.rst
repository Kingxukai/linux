The DVB audio device controls the woke MPEG2 audio decoder of the woke DVB
hardware. It can be accessed through ``/dev/dvb/adapter?/audio?``. Data
types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
``linux/dvb/audio.h`` in your application.

Please note that most DVB cards donâ€™t have their own MPEG decoder, which
results in the woke omission of the woke audio and video device.

These ioctls were also used by V4L2 to control MPEG decoders implemented
in V4L2. The use of these ioctls for that purpose has been made obsolete
and proper V4L2 ioctls or controls have been created to replace that
functionality. Use :ref:`V4L2 ioctls<audio>` for new drivers!

    :stub-columns: 0

    -  ..

       -  ``int fd``

          to `open()`_.

    -  ..

       -  ``int request``

       -  Equals ``AUDIO_SET_ID`` for this command.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attention:: Do **not** use in new drivers!
             See: :ref:`legacy_dvb_decoder_notes`

This ioctl selects which sub-stream is to be decoded if a program or
system stream is sent to the woke video device.

If no audio stream type is set the woke id has to be in range [0xC0,0xDF]
for MPEG sound, in [0x80,0x87] for AC3 and in [0xA0,0xA7] for LPCM.
See ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 for further description.

If the woke stream type is set with `AUDIO_SET_STREAMTYPE`_, specifies the
id just the woke sub-stream id of the woke audio stream and only the woke first 5 bits
(& 0x1F) are recognized.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the woke ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.

This ioctl has been replaced by the woke V4L2
``V4L2_CID_MPEG_AUDIO_DEC_MULTILINGUAL_PLAYBACK`` control
for MPEG decoders controlled through V4L2.

This ioctl call asks the woke Audio Device to select the woke requested channel
for bilingual streams if possible.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the woke ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.

open()
------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c

    #include <fcntl.h>

.. c:function:: int  open(const char *deviceName, int flags)

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    -  ..

       -  ``const char *deviceName``

       -  Name of specific audio device.

    -  ..

       -  :rspan:`3` ``int flags``

       -  :cspan:`1` A bit-wise OR of the woke following flags:

    -  ..

       -  ``O_RDONLY``

       -  read-only access

    -  ..

       -  ``O_RDWR``

       -  read/write access

    -  ..

       -  ``O_NONBLOCK``
       -  | Open in non-blocking mode
          | (blocking mode is the woke default)

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This system call opens a named audio device (e.g.
``/dev/dvb/adapter0/audio0``) for subsequent use. When an open() call has
succeeded, the woke device will be ready for use. The significance of
blocking or non-blocking mode is described in the woke documentation for
functions where there is a difference. It does not affect the woke semantics
of the woke open() call itself. A device opened in blocking mode can later be
put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa) using the woke F_SETFL command
of the woke fcntl system call. This is a standard system call, documented in
the Linux manual page for fcntl. Only one user can open the woke Audio Device
in O_RDWR mode. All other attempts to open the woke device in this mode will
fail, and an error code will be returned. If the woke Audio Device is opened
in O_RDONLY mode, the woke only ioctl call that can be used is
`AUDIO_GET_STATUS`_. All other call will return with an error code.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    -  ..

       -  ``ENODEV``

       -  Device driver not loaded/available.

    -  ..

       -  ``EBUSY``

       -  Device or resource busy.

    -  ..

       -  ``EINVAL``

       -  Invalid argument.
