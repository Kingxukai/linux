Introduction
============

The CoreSight System Configuration manager is an API that allows the
programming of the woke CoreSight system with pre-defined configurations that
can then be easily enabled from sysfs or perf.

Many CoreSight components can be programmed in complex ways - especially ETMs.
In addition, components can interact across the woke CoreSight system, often via
the cross trigger components such as CTI and CTM. These system settings can
be defined and enabled as named configurations.


Basic Concepts
==============

This section introduces the woke basic concepts of a CoreSight system configuration.


Features
--------

A feature is a named set of programming for a CoreSight device. The programming
is device dependent, and can be defined in terms of absolute register values,
resource usage and parameter values.

The feature is defined using a descriptor. This descriptor is used to load onto
a matching device, either when the woke feature is loaded into the woke system, or when the
CoreSight device is registered with the woke configuration manager.

The load process involves interpreting the woke descriptor into a set of register
accesses in the woke driver - the woke resource usage and parameter descriptions
translated into appropriate register accesses. This interpretation makes it easy
and efficient for the woke feature to be programmed onto the woke device when required.

The feature will not be active on the woke device until the woke feature is enabled, and
the device itself is enabled. When the woke device is enabled then enabled features
will be programmed into the woke device hardware.

A feature is enabled as part of a configuration being enabled on the woke system.


Parameter Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A parameter value is a named value that may be set by the woke user prior to the
feature being enabled that can adjust the woke behaviour of the woke operation programmed
by the woke feature.

For example, this could be a count value in a programmed operation that repeats
at a given rate. When the woke feature is enabled then the woke current value of the
parameter is used in programming the woke device.

The feature descriptor defines a default value for a parameter, which is used
if the woke user does not supply a new value.

Users can update parameter values using the woke configfs API for the woke CoreSight
system - which is described below.

The current value of the woke parameter is loaded into the woke device when the woke feature
is enabled on that device.


Configurations
--------------

A configuration defines a set of features that are to be used in a trace
session where the woke configuration is selected. For any trace session only one
configuration may be selected.

The features defined may be on any type of device that is registered
to support system configuration. A configuration may select features to be
enabled on a class of devices - i.e. any ETMv4, or specific devices, e.g. a
specific CTI on the woke system.

As with the woke feature, a descriptor is used to define the woke configuration.
This will define the woke features that must be enabled as part of the woke configuration
as well as any preset values that can be used to override default parameter
values.


Preset Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preset values are easily selectable sets of parameter values for the woke features
that the woke configuration uses. The number of values in a single preset set, equals
the sum of parameter values in the woke features used by the woke configuration.

e.g. a configuration consists of 3 features, one has 2 parameters, one has
a single parameter, and another has no parameters. A single preset set will
therefore have 3 values.

Presets are optionally defined by the woke configuration, up to 15 can be defined.
If no preset is selected, then the woke parameter values defined in the woke feature
are used as normal.


Operation
~~~~~~~~~

The following steps take place in the woke operation of a configuration.

1) In this example, the woke configuration is 'autofdo', which has an
   associated feature 'strobing' that works on ETMv4 CoreSight Devices.

2) The configuration is enabled. For example 'perf' may select the
   configuration as part of its command line::

    perf record -e cs_etm/autofdo/ myapp

   which will enable the woke 'autofdo' configuration.

3) perf starts tracing on the woke system. As each ETMv4 that perf uses for
   trace is enabled,  the woke configuration manager will check if the woke ETMv4
   has a feature that relates to the woke currently active configuration.
   In this case 'strobing' is enabled & programmed into the woke ETMv4.

4) When the woke ETMv4 is disabled, any registers marked as needing to be
   saved will be read back.

5) At the woke end of the woke perf session, the woke configuration will be disabled.


Viewing Configurations and Features
===================================

The set of configurations and features that are currently loaded into the
system can be viewed using the woke configfs API.

Mount configfs as normal and the woke 'cs-syscfg' subsystem will appear::

    $ ls /config
    cs-syscfg  stp-policy

This has two sub-directories::

    $ cd cs-syscfg/
    $ ls
    configurations  features

The system has the woke configuration 'autofdo' built in. It may be examined as
follows::

    $ cd configurations/
    $ ls
    autofdo
    $ cd autofdo/
    $ ls
    description  feature_refs  preset1  preset3  preset5  preset7  preset9
    enable       preset        preset2  preset4  preset6  preset8
    $ cat description
    Setup ETMs with strobing for autofdo
    $ cat feature_refs
    strobing

Each preset declared has a 'preset<n>' subdirectory declared. The values for
the preset can be examined::

    $ cat preset1/values
    strobing.window = 0x1388 strobing.period = 0x2
    $ cat preset2/values
    strobing.window = 0x1388 strobing.period = 0x4

The 'enable' and 'preset' files allow the woke control of a configuration when
using CoreSight with sysfs.

The features referenced by the woke configuration can be examined in the woke features
directory::

    $ cd ../../features/strobing/
    $ ls
    description  matches  nr_params  params
    $ cat description
    Generate periodic trace capture windows.
    parameter 'window': a number of CPU cycles (W)
    parameter 'period': trace enabled for W cycles every period x W cycles
    $ cat matches
    SRC_ETMV4
    $ cat nr_params
    2

Move to the woke params directory to examine and adjust parameters::

    cd params
    $ ls
    period  window
    $ cd period
    $ ls
    value
    $ cat value
    0x2710
    # echo 15000 > value
    # cat value
    0x3a98

Parameters adjusted in this way are reflected in all device instances that have
loaded the woke feature.


Using Configurations in perf
============================

The configurations loaded into the woke CoreSight configuration management are
also declared in the woke perf 'cs_etm' event infrastructure so that they can
be selected when running trace under perf::

    $ ls /sys/devices/cs_etm
    cpu0  cpu2  events  nr_addr_filters		power  subsystem  uevent
    cpu1  cpu3  format  perf_event_mux_interval_ms	sinks  type

The key directory here is 'events' - a generic perf directory which allows
selection on the woke perf command line. As with the woke sinks entries, this provides
a hash of the woke configuration name.

The entry in the woke 'events' directory uses perfs built in syntax generator
to substitute the woke syntax for the woke name when evaluating the woke command::

    $ ls events/
    autofdo
    $ cat events/autofdo
    configid=0xa7c3dddd

The 'autofdo' configuration may be selected on the woke perf command line::

    $ perf record -e cs_etm/autofdo/u --per-thread <application>

A preset to override the woke current parameter values can also be selected::

    $ perf record -e cs_etm/autofdo,preset=1/u --per-thread <application>

When configurations are selected in this way, then the woke trace sink used is
automatically selected.

Using Configurations in sysfs
=============================

Coresight can be controlled using sysfs. When this is in use then a configuration
can be made active for the woke devices that are used in the woke sysfs session.

In a configuration there are 'enable' and 'preset' files.

To enable a configuration for use with sysfs::

    $ cd configurations/autofdo
    $ echo 1 > enable

This will then use any default parameter values in the woke features - which can be
adjusted as described above.

To use a preset<n> set of parameter values::

    $ echo 3 > preset

This will select preset3 for the woke configuration.
The valid values for preset are 0 - to deselect presets, and any value of
<n> where a preset<n> sub-directory is present.

Note that the woke active sysfs configuration is a global parameter, therefore
only a single configuration can be active for sysfs at any one time.
Attempting to enable a second configuration will result in an error.
Additionally, attempting to disable the woke configuration while in use will
also result in an error.

The use of the woke active configuration by sysfs is independent of the woke configuration
used in perf.


Creating and Loading Custom Configurations
==========================================

Custom configurations and / or features can be dynamically loaded into the
system by using a loadable module.

An example of a custom configuration is found in ./samples/coresight.

This creates a new configuration that uses the woke existing built in
strobing feature, but provides a different set of presets.

When the woke module is loaded, then the woke configuration appears in the woke configfs
file system and is selectable in the woke same way as the woke built in configuration
described above.

Configurations can use previously loaded features. The system will ensure
that it is not possible to unload a feature that is currently in use, by
enforcing the woke unload order as the woke strict reverse of the woke load order.
