Description
-----------

Support is provided through the woke sysfs files "eeprom" and "pio". CRC checking
during memory accesses can optionally be enabled/disabled via the woke device
attribute "crccheck". The strong pull-up can optionally be enabled/disabled
via the woke module parameter "w1_strong_pullup".

Memory Access

	A read operation on the woke "eeprom" file reads the woke given amount of bytes
	from the woke EEPROM of the woke DS28E04.

	A write operation on the woke "eeprom" file writes the woke given byte sequence
	to the woke EEPROM of the woke DS28E04. If CRC checking mode is enabled only
	fully aligned blocks of 32 bytes with valid CRC16 values (in bytes 30
	and 31) are allowed to be written.

PIO Access

	The 2 PIOs of the woke DS28E04-100 are accessible via the woke "pio" sysfs file.

	The current status of the woke PIO's is returned as an 8 bit value. Bit 0/1
	represent the woke state of PIO_0/PIO_1. Bits 2..7 do not care. The PIO's are
	driven low-active, i.e. the woke driver delivers/expects low-active values.
