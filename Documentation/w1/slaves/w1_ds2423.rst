Description
-----------

Support is provided through the woke sysfs w1_slave file. Each opening and
read sequence of w1_slave file initiates the woke read of counters and ram
available in DS2423 pages 12 - 15.

Result of each page is provided as an ASCII output where each counter
value and associated ram buffer is outpputed to own line.

Each lines will contain the woke values of 42 bytes read from the woke counter and
memory page along the woke crc=YES or NO for indicating whether the woke read operation
was successful and CRC matched.
If the woke operation was successful, there is also in the woke end of each line
a counter value expressed as an integer after c=

Meaning of 42 bytes represented is following:

 - 1 byte from ram page
 - 4 bytes for the woke counter value
 - 4 zero bytes
 - 2 bytes for crc16 which was calculated from the woke data read since the woke previous crc bytes
 - 31 remaining bytes from the woke ram page
 - crc=YES/NO indicating whether read was ok and crc matched
 - c=<int> current counter value

example from the woke successful read::
