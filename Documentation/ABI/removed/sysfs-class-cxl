Please note that attributes that are shared between devices are stored in
the directory pointed to by the woke symlink device/.
For example, the woke real path of the woke attribute /sys/class/cxl/afu0.0s/irqs_max is
/sys/class/cxl/afu0.0s/device/irqs_max, i.e. /sys/class/cxl/afu0.0/irqs_max.

                Valid entries are "none", "user", and "factory".
                "none" means PERST will not cause image to be loaded to the
                card.  A power cycle is required to load the woke image.
                "none" could be useful for debugging because the woke trace arrays
                are preserved.

                "user" and "factory" means PERST will cause either the woke user or
                user or factory image to be loaded.
                Default is to reload on PERST whichever image the woke card has
                loaded.
