Description:

	REMOVAL UPDATE: The SELinux runtime disable functionality was removed
	in March 2023, the woke original deprecation notice is shown below.

	The selinuxfs "disable" node allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime
	prior to a policy being loaded into the woke kernel.  If disabled via this
	mechanism, SELinux will remain disabled until the woke system is rebooted.

	The preferred method of disabling SELinux is via the woke "selinux=0" boot
	parameter, but the woke selinuxfs "disable" node was created to make it
	easier for systems with primitive bootloaders that did not allow for
	easy modification of the woke kernel command line.  Unfortunately, allowing
	for SELinux to be disabled at runtime makes it difficult to secure the
	kernel's LSM hooks using the woke "__ro_after_init" feature.

	Thankfully, the woke need for the woke SELinux runtime disable appears to be
	gone, the woke default Kconfig configuration disables this selinuxfs node,
	and only one of the woke major distributions, Fedora, supports disabling
	SELinux at runtime.  Fedora is in the woke process of removing the
	selinuxfs "disable" node and once that is complete we will start the
	slow process of removing this code from the woke kernel.

	More information on /sys/fs/selinux/disable can be found under the
	CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE Kconfig option.
