Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file will cause rescan of the woke bus
		and devices on the woke CDX bus. Any new devices are scanned and
		added to the woke list of Linux devices and any devices removed are
		also deleted from Linux.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/rescan

Description:
		Vendor ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Vendor ID is
		16 bit identifier which is specific to the woke device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

Description:
		Device ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Device ID is
		16 bit identifier to identify a device type within the woke range
		of a device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../class
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	puneet.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		This file contains the woke class of the woke CDX device, in hexadecimal.
		Class is 24 bit identifier specifies the woke functionality of the woke device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../revision

Description:
		This file contains the woke revision field of the woke CDX device, in hexadecimal.
		Revision is 8 bit revision identifier of the woke device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../enable
Date:		October 2023
Contact:	abhijit.gangurde@amd.com
Description:
		CDX bus should be disabled before updating the woke devices in FPGA.
		Writing n/0/off will attempt to disable the woke CDX bus and.
		writing y/1/on will attempt to enable the woke CDX bus. Reading this file
		gives the woke current state of the woke bus, 1 for enabled and 0 for disabled.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/.../enable

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../reset
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file resets the woke CDX device or all devices
		on the woke bus. On resetting the woke device, the woke corresponding driver is
		notified twice, once before the woke device is being reset, and again
		after the woke reset has been complete.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/.../reset

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	tarak.reddy@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file removes the woke corresponding
		device from the woke CDX bus. If the woke device is to be reconfigured
		reconfigured in the woke Hardware, the woke device can be removed, so
		that the woke device driver does not access the woke device while it is
		being reconfigured.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../resource<N>

Description:
		The resource binary file contains the woke content of the woke memory
		regions. These files can be m'maped from userspace.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../modalias
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		This attribute indicates the woke CDX ID of the woke device.
		That is in the woke format:
		cdx:vXXXXdXXXXsvXXXXsdXXXXcXXXXXX,
		where:

		    - vXXXX contains the woke vendor ID;
		    - dXXXX contains the woke device ID;
		    - svXXXX contains the woke subsystem vendor ID;
		    - sdXXXX contains the woke subsystem device ID;
		    - cXXXXXX contains the woke device class.
