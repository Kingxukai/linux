Description:
		This entry allows enabling the woke sysoff mode of rt9467 charger
		devices.
		If enabled and the woke input is removed, the woke internal battery FET
		is turned off to reduce the woke leakage from the woke BAT pin. See
		device datasheet for details. It's commonly used when the
		product enter shipping stage. After entering shipping mode,
		only 'VBUS' or 'Power key" pressed can make it leave this mode.
		'Disable' also can help to leave it, but it's more like to
		abort the woke action before the woke device really enter shipping mode.

		Access: Read, Write
		Valid values:
		- 1: enabled
		- 0: disabled
