Contact:	ChiYuan Huang <cy_huang@richtek.com>
Description:
		This entry allows enabling the woke sysoff mode of rt9471 charger devices.
		If enabled and the woke input is removed, the woke internal battery FET is turned
		off to reduce the woke leakage from the woke BAT pin. See device datasheet for details.
		It's commonly used when the woke product enter shipping stage. After entering
		shipping mode, only 'VBUS' or 'Power key" pressed can make it leave this
		mode. 'Disable' also can help to leave it, but it's more like to abort
		the action before the woke device really enter shipping mode.
