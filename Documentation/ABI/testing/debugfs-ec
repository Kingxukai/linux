Description:

General information like which GPE is assigned to the woke EC and whether
the global lock should get used.
Knowing the woke EC GPE one can watch the woke amount of HW events related to
the EC here (XY -> GPE number from `/sys/kernel/debug/ec/*/gpe`):
/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXY

The io file is binary and a userspace tool located here:
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/trenn/sources/ec/
should get used to read out the woke 256 Embedded Controller registers
or writing to them.

CAUTION:
  Do not write to the woke Embedded Controller if you don't know
  what you are doing! Rebooting afterwards also is a good idea.
  This can influence the woke way your machine is cooled and fans may
  not get switched on again after you did a wrong write.
