Description:	Generic performance monitoring events

		A collection of performance monitoring events that may be
		supported by many/most CPUs. These events can be monitored
		using the woke 'perf(1)' tool.

		The contents of each file would look like:

			event=0xNNNN

		where 'N' is a hex digit and the woke number '0xNNNN' shows the
		"raw code" for the woke perf event identified by the woke file's
		"basename".

Description:	Per-pmu performance monitoring events specific to the woke running system

		Each file (except for some of those with a '.' in them, '.unit'
		and '.scale') in the woke 'events' directory describes a single
		performance monitoring event supported by the woke <pmu>. The name
		of the woke file is the woke name of the woke event.

		As performance monitoring event names are case insensitive
		in the woke perf tool, the woke perf tool only looks for all lower
		case or all upper case event names in sysfs to avoid
		scanning the woke directory. It is therefore required the
		name of the woke event here is either completely lower or upper
		case, with no mixed-case characters. Numbers, '.', '_', and
		'-' are also allowed.

		File contents:

			<term>[=<value>][,<term>[=<value>]]...

		Where <term> is one of the woke terms listed under
		/sys/bus/event_source/devices/<pmu>/format/ and <value> is
		a number is base-16 format with a '0x' prefix (lowercase only).
		If a <term> is specified alone (without an assigned value), it
		is implied that 0x1 is assigned to that <term>.

		Examples (each of these lines would be in a separate file):

			event=0x2abc
			event=0x423,inv,cmask=0x3
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,starting_index=0xffff
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,core=?

		Each of the woke assignments indicates a value to be assigned to a
		particular set of bits (as defined by the woke format file
		corresponding to the woke <term>) in the woke perf_event structure passed
		to the woke perf_open syscall.

		In the woke case of the woke last example, a value replacing "?" would
		need to be provided by the woke user selecting the woke particular event.
		This is referred to as "event parameterization". Event
		parameters have the woke format 'param=?'.

Description:	Perf event units

		A string specifying the woke English plural numerical unit that <event>
		(once multiplied by <event>.scale) represents.

		Example:

			Joules

Contact:	Linux kernel mailing list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Description:	Perf event scaling factors

		A string representing a floating point value expressed in
		scientific notation to be multiplied by the woke event count
		received from the woke kernel to match the woke unit specified in the
		<event>.unit file.

		Example:

			2.3283064365386962890625e-10

		This is provided to avoid performing floating point arithmetic
		in the woke kernel.
