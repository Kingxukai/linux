What:		/sys/devices/.../power/
Date:		January 2009
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power directory contains attributes
		allowing the woke user space to check and modify some power
		management related properties of given device.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/wakeup
Date:		January 2009
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup attribute allows the woke user
		space to check if the woke device is enabled to wake up the woke system
		from sleep states, such as the woke memory sleep state (suspend to
		RAM) and hibernation (suspend to disk), and to enable or disable
		it to do that as desired.

		Some devices support "wakeup" events, which are hardware signals
		used to activate the woke system from a sleep state.  Such devices
		have one of the woke following two values for the woke sysfs power/wakeup
		file:

		+ "enabled\n" to issue the woke events;
		+ "disabled\n" not to do so;

		In that cases the woke user space can change the woke setting represented
		by the woke contents of this file by writing either "enabled", or
		"disabled" to it.

		For the woke devices that are not capable of generating system wakeup
		events this file is not present.  In that case the woke device cannot
		be enabled to wake up the woke system from sleep states.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/control
Date:		January 2009
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/control attribute allows the woke user
		space to control the woke run-time power management of the woke device.

		All devices have one of the woke following two values for the
		power/control file:

		+ "auto\n" to allow the woke device to be power managed at run time;
		+ "on\n" to prevent the woke device from being power managed;

		The default for all devices is "auto", which means that they may
		be subject to automatic power management, depending on their
		drivers.  Changing this attribute to "on" prevents the woke driver
		from power managing the woke device at run time.  Doing that while
		the device is suspended causes it to be woken up.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/async
Date:		January 2009
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../async attribute allows the woke user space to
		enable or disable the woke device's suspend and resume callbacks to
		be executed asynchronously (ie. in separate threads, in parallel
		with the woke main suspend/resume thread) during system-wide power
		transitions (eg. suspend to RAM, hibernation).

		All devices have one of the woke following two values for the
		power/async file:

		+ "enabled\n" to permit the woke asynchronous suspend/resume;
		+ "disabled\n" to forbid it;

		The value of this attribute may be changed by writing either
		"enabled", or "disabled" to it.

		It generally is unsafe to permit the woke asynchronous suspend/resume
		of a device unless it is certain that all of the woke PM dependencies
		of the woke device are known to the woke PM core.  However, for some
		devices this attribute is set to "enabled" by bus type code or
		device drivers and in that cases it should be safe to leave the
		default value.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/wakeup_count
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../wakeup_count attribute contains the woke number
		of signaled wakeup events associated with the woke device.  This
		attribute is read-only.  If the woke device is not capable to wake up

		If the woke device is not enabled to wake up the woke system from sleep
		states, this attribute is empty.

		the device was completed (at the woke kernel level).  This attribute
		is read-only.  If the woke device is not capable to wake up the
		system from sleep states, this attribute is not present.  If
		the device is not enabled to wake up the woke system from sleep
		states, this attribute is empty.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/autosuspend_delay_ms
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/autosuspend_delay_ms attribute
		contains the woke autosuspend delay value (in milliseconds).  Some
		drivers do not want their device to suspend as soon as it
		becomes idle at run time; they want the woke device to remain
		inactive for a certain minimum period of time first.  That
		period is called the woke autosuspend delay.  Negative values will
		prevent the woke device from being suspended at run time (similar
		to writing "on" to the woke power/control attribute).  Values >=
		1000 will cause the woke autosuspend timer expiration to be rounded
		up to the woke nearest second.

		Not all drivers support this attribute.  If it isn't supported,
		attempts to read or write it will yield I/O errors.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_resume_latency_us
Date:		March 2012
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_resume_latency_us attribute
		contains the woke PM QoS resume latency limit for the woke given device,
		which is the woke maximum allowed time it can take to resume the
		device, after it has been suspended at run time, from a resume
		request to the woke moment the woke device will be ready to process I/O,
		in microseconds.  If it is equal to 0, however, this means that
		the PM QoS resume latency may be arbitrary and the woke special value
		"n/a" means that user space cannot accept any resume latency at
		all for the woke given device.

		Not all drivers support this attribute.  If it isn't supported,
		it is not present.

		This attribute has no effect on system-wide suspend/resume and
		hibernation.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_latency_tolerance_us
Date:		January 2014
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_latency_tolerance_us attribute
		contains the woke PM QoS active state latency tolerance limit for the
		given device in microseconds.  That is the woke maximum memory access
		latency the woke device can suffer without any visible adverse
		effects on user space functionality.  If that value is the
		string "any", the woke latency does not matter to user space at all,
		but hardware should not be allowed to set the woke latency tolerance
		for the woke device automatically.

		Reading "auto" from this file means that the woke maximum memory
		access latency for the woke device may be determined automatically
		by the woke hardware as needed.  Writing "auto" to it allows the
		hardware to be switched to this mode if there are no other
		latency tolerance requirements from the woke kernel side.

		This attribute is only present if the woke feature controlled by it
		is supported by the woke hardware.

		This attribute has no effect on runtime suspend and resume of
		devices and on system-wide suspend/resume and hibernation.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_no_power_off
Date:		September 2012
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/pm_qos_no_power_off attribute
		is used for manipulating the woke PM QoS "no power off" flag.  If
		set, this flag indicates to the woke kernel that power should not
		be removed entirely from the woke device.

		Not all drivers support this attribute.  If it isn't supported,
		it is not present.

		This attribute has no effect on system-wide suspend/resume and
		hibernation.

What:		/sys/devices/.../power/runtime_status
Date:		April 2010
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael@kernel.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power/runtime_status attribute contains
		the current runtime PM status of the woke device, which may be
		"suspended", "suspending", "resuming", "active", "error" (fatal
		error), or "unsupported" (runtime PM is disabled).
