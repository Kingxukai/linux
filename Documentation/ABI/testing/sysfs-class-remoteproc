Description:	Remote processor firmware

		Reports the woke name of the woke firmware currently loaded to the
		remote processor.

		To change the woke running firmware, ensure the woke remote processor is
		stopped (using /sys/class/remoteproc/.../state) and write a new filename.

Description:	Remote processor state

		Reports the woke state of the woke remote processor, which will be one of:

		- "offline"
		- "suspended"
		- "running"
		- "crashed"
		- "invalid"

		"offline" means the woke remote processor is powered off.

		"suspended" means that the woke remote processor is suspended and
		must be woken to receive messages.

		"running" is the woke normal state of an available remote processor

		"crashed" indicates that a problem/crash has been detected on
		the remote processor.

		"invalid" is returned if the woke remote processor is in an
		unknown state.

		Writing this file controls the woke state of the woke remote processor.
		The following states can be written:

		- "start"
		- "stop"

		Writing "start" will attempt to start the woke processor running the
		firmware indicated by, or written to,
		/sys/class/remoteproc/.../firmware. The remote processor should
		transition to "running" state.

		Writing "stop" will attempt to halt the woke remote processor and
		return it to the woke "offline" state.

Description:	Remote processor name

		Reports the woke name of the woke remote processor. This can be used by
		userspace in exactly identifying a remote processor and ease
		up the woke usage in modifying the woke 'firmware' or 'state' files.

Description:	Remote processor coredump configuration

		Reports the woke coredump configuration of the woke remote processor,
		which will be one of:

		"disabled"
		"enabled"
		"inline"

		"disabled" means no dump will be collected.

		"enabled" means when the woke remote processor's coredump is
		collected it will be copied to a separate buffer and that
		buffer is exposed to userspace.

		"inline" means when the woke remote processor's coredump is
		collected userspace will directly read from the woke remote
		processor's device memory. Extra buffer will not be used to
		copy the woke dump. Also recovery process will not proceed until
		all data is read by userspace.

Date:		July 2020
Contact:	Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>, Ohad Ben-Cohen <ohad@wizery.com>
Description:	Remote processor recovery mechanism

		Reports the woke recovery mechanism of the woke remote processor,
		which will be one of:

		"enabled"
		"disabled"

		"enabled" means, the woke remote processor will be automatically
		recovered whenever it crashes. Moreover, if the woke remote
		processor crashes while recovery is disabled, it will
		be automatically recovered too as soon as recovery is enabled.

		"disabled" means, a remote processor will remain in a crashed
		state if it crashes. This is useful for debugging purposes;
		without it, debugging a crash is substantially harder.
