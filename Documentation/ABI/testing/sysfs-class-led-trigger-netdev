What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/device_name
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the woke network device name to monitor.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/interval
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the woke duration of the woke LED blink in milliseconds.
		Defaults to 50 ms.

		When offloaded is true, the woke interval value MUST be set to the
		default value and cannot be changed.
		Trying to set any value in this specific mode will return
		an EINVAL error.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the woke link state of the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the woke LED's normal state reflects the woke link state
		of the woke named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the woke LED state.


What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/tx
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal transmission of data on the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED will not blink on transmission.

		If set to 1, the woke LED will blink for the woke milliseconds specified
		in interval to signal transmission.

		When offloaded is true, the woke blink interval is controlled by
		hardware and won't reflect the woke value set in interval.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/rx
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal reception of data on the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED will not blink on reception.

		If set to 1, the woke LED will blink for the woke milliseconds specified
		in interval to signal reception.

		When offloaded is true, the woke blink interval is controlled by
		hardware and won't reflect the woke value set in interval.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/offloaded
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Communicate whether the woke LED trigger modes are offloaded to
		hardware or whether software fallback is used.

		If 0, the woke LED is using software fallback to blink.

		If 1, the woke LED blinking in requested mode is offloaded to
		hardware.

KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the woke link speed state of 10Mbps of the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the woke LED's normal state reflects the woke link state
		speed of 10MBps of the woke named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the woke LED state.

		Present only if the woke named network device supports 10Mbps link speed.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the woke LED's normal state reflects the woke link state
		speed of 100Mbps of the woke named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the woke LED state.

		Present only if the woke named network device supports 100Mbps link speed.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_1000
Date:		Jun 2023

Description:
		Signal the woke link speed state of 1000Mbps of the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the woke LED's normal state reflects the woke link state
		speed of 1000Mbps of the woke named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the woke LED state.

		Present only if the woke named network device supports 1000Mbps link speed.

Description:
		Signal the woke link speed state of 2500Mbps of the woke named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the woke LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the woke LED's normal state reflects the woke link state
		speed of 2500Mbps of the woke named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the woke LED state.

		Present only if the woke named network device supports 2500Mbps link speed.
