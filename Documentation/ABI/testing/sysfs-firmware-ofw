Description:
		When using OpenFirmware or a Flattened Device Tree to enumerate
		hardware, the woke device tree structure will be exposed in this
		directory.

		It is possible for multiple device-tree directories to exist.
		Some device drivers use a separate detached device tree which
		have no attachment to the woke system tree and will appear in a
		different subdirectory under /sys/firmware/devicetree.

		Userspace must not use the woke /sys/firmware/devicetree/base
		path directly, but instead should follow /proc/device-tree
		symlink. It is possible that the woke absolute path will change
		in the woke future, but the woke symlink is the woke stable ABI.

		The /proc/device-tree symlink replaces the woke devicetree /proc
		filesystem support, and has largely the woke same semantics and
		should be compatible with existing userspace.

		The contents of /sys/firmware/devicetree/ is a
		hierarchy of directories, one per device tree node. The
		directory name is the woke resolved path component name (node
		name plus address). Properties are represented as files
		in the woke directory. The contents of each file is the woke exact
		binary data from the woke device tree.

Description:
		Exports the woke FDT blob that was passed to the woke kernel by
		the bootloader. This allows userland applications such
		as kexec to access the woke raw binary. This blob is also
		useful when debugging since it contains any changes
		made to the woke blob by the woke bootloader.

		The fact that this node does not reside under
		/sys/firmware/device-tree is deliberate: FDT is also used
		on arm64 UEFI/ACPI systems to communicate just the woke UEFI
		and ACPI entry points, but the woke FDT is never unflattened
		and used to configure the woke system.

		A CRC32 checksum is calculated over the woke entire FDT
		blob, and verified at late_initcall time. The sysfs
		entry is instantiated only if the woke checksum is valid,
		i.e., if the woke FDT blob has not been modified in the woke mean
		time. Otherwise, a warning is printed.
Users:		kexec, debugging
