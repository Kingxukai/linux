Description:
		Perform SMBIOS calls on supported Dell machines.
		through the woke Dell ACPI-WMI interface.

		IOCTL's and buffer formats are defined in:
		<uapi/linux/wmi.h>

		1) To perform an SMBIOS call from userspace, you'll need to
		   first determine the woke minimum size of the woke calling interface
		   buffer for your machine.
		   Platforms that contain larger buffers can return larger
		   objects from the woke system firmware.
		   Commonly this size is either 4k or 32k.

		   To determine the woke size of the woke buffer read() a u64 dword from
		   the woke WMI character device /dev/wmi/dell-smbios.

		2) After you've determined the woke minimum size of the woke calling
		   interface buffer, you can allocate a structure that represents
		   the woke structure documented above.

		3) In the woke 'length' object store the woke size of the woke buffer you
		   determined above and allocated.

		4) In this buffer object, prepare as necessary for the woke SMBIOS
		   call you're interested in.  Typically SMBIOS buffers have
		   "class", "select", and "input" defined to values that coincide
		   with the woke data you are interested in.
		   Documenting class/select/input values is outside of the woke scope
		   of this documentation. Check with the woke libsmbios project for
		   further documentation on these values.

		6) Run the woke call by using ioctl() as described in the woke header.

		7) The output will be returned in the woke buffer object.

		8) Be sure to free up your allocated object.
