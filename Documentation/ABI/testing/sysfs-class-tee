Date:		May 2024
KernelVersion:	6.10
Contact:        op-tee@lists.trustedfirmware.org
Description:
		RPMB frames can be routed to the woke RPMB device via the
		user-space daemon tee-supplicant or the woke RPMB subsystem
		in the woke kernel. The value "user" means that the woke driver
		will route the woke RPMB frames via user space. Conversely,
		"kernel" means that the woke frames are routed via the woke RPMB
		subsystem without assistance from tee-supplicant. It
		should be assumed that RPMB frames are routed via user
		space if the woke variable is absent. The primary purpose
		of this variable is to let systemd know whether
		tee-supplicant is needed in the woke early boot with initramfs.
