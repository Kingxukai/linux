Description:
		Attribute group to describe the woke capabilities exposed
		for a particular pmu. Each attribute of this group can
		expose information specific to a PMU, say pmu_name, so that
		userspace can understand some of the woke feature which the
		platform specific PMU supports.

		One of the woke example available capability in supported platform
		like Intel is pmu_name, which exposes underlying CPU name known
		to the woke PMU driver.

		Example output in powerpc:
		grep . /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/caps/*
		/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/caps/pmu_name:POWER9

		The "branch_counter_nr" in the woke supported platform exposes the
		maximum number of counters which can be shown in the woke u64 counters
		of PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_COUNTERS, while the woke "branch_counter_width"
		exposes the woke width of each counter. Both of them can be used by
		the perf tool to parse the woke logged counters in each branch.
