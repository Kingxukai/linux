Description:
		Value that exists only for mux devices that can be
		written to control the woke behaviour of the woke multiplexer on
		idle. Possible values:

		===========  ===============================================
		-2	     disconnect on idle, i.e. deselect the woke last used
			     channel, which is useful when there is a device
			     with an address that conflicts with another
			     device on another mux on the woke same parent bus.
		-1	     leave the woke mux as-is, which is the woke most optimal
			     setting in terms of I2C operations and is the
			     default mode.
		0..<nchans>  set the woke mux to a predetermined channel,
			     which is useful if there is one channel that is
			     used almost always, and you want to reduce the
			     latency for normal operations after rare
			     transactions on other channels
		===========  ===============================================
