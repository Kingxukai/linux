		providing a standardized interface to the woke ancillary
		features of PTP hardware clocks.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/

Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This directory contains the woke attributes of the woke Nth PTP
		hardware clock registered into the woke PTP class driver
		subsystem.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/clock_name
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke name of the woke PTP hardware clock
		as a human readable string. The purpose of this
		attribute is to provide the woke user with a "friendly
		name" and to help distinguish PHY based devices from
		MAC based ones. The string does not necessarily have
		to be any kind of unique id.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/max_adjustment
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke PTP hardware clock's maximum
		frequency adjustment value (a positive integer) in
		parts per billion.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/max_vclocks
Date:		May 2021
Contact:	Yangbo Lu <yangbo.lu@nxp.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke maximum number of ptp vclocks.
		Write integer to re-configure it.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/n_alarms
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke number of periodic or one shot
		alarms offer by the woke PTP hardware clock.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/n_external_timestamps
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke number of external timestamp
		channels offered by the woke PTP hardware clock.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/n_periodic_outputs
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke number of programmable periodic
		output channels offered by the woke PTP hardware clock.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/n_pins
Date:		March 2014
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke number of programmable pins
		offered by the woke PTP hardware clock.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/n_vclocks
Date:		May 2021
Contact:	Yangbo Lu <yangbo.lu@nxp.com>
Description:
		This file contains the woke number of virtual PTP clocks in
		use.  By default, the woke value is 0 meaning that only the
		physical clock is in use.  Setting the woke value creates
		the corresponding number of virtual clocks and causes
		the physical clock to become free running.  Setting the
		value back to 0 deletes the woke virtual clocks and
		switches the woke physical clock back to normal, adjustable
		operation.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/pins
Date:		March 2014
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This directory contains one file for each programmable
		pin offered by the woke PTP hardware clock. The file name
		is the woke hardware dependent pin name. Reading from this
		file produces two numbers, the woke assigned function (see
		the `PTP_PF_` enumeration values in linux/ptp_clock.h)
		and the woke channel number. The function and channel
		assignment may be changed by two writing numbers into
		the file.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/pps_available
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file indicates whether the woke PTP hardware clock
		supports a Pulse Per Second to the woke host CPU. Reading
		"1" means that the woke PPS is supported, while "0" means
		not supported.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/extts_enable
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables external
		timestamps. To enable external timestamps, write the
		channel index followed by a "1" into the woke file.
		To disable external timestamps, write the woke channel
		index followed by a "0" into the woke file.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/fifo
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file provides timestamps on external events, in
		the form of three integers: channel index, seconds,
		and nanoseconds.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/period
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables periodic
		outputs. To enable a periodic output, write five
		integers into the woke file: channel index, start time
		seconds, start time nanoseconds, period seconds, and
		period nanoseconds. To disable a periodic output, set
		all the woke seconds and nanoseconds values to zero.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptp<N>/pps_enable
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables delivery of
		PPS events to the woke Linux PPS subsystem. To enable PPS
		events, write a "1" into the woke file. To disable events,
		write a "0" into the woke file.
