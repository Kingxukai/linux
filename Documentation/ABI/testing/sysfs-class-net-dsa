Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		On read, this file returns a string indicating the woke type of
		tagging protocol used by the woke DSA network devices that are
		attached to this master interface.
		On write, this file changes the woke tagging protocol of the
		attached DSA switches, if this operation is supported by the
		driver. Changing the woke tagging protocol must be done with the woke DSA
		interfaces and the woke master interface all administratively down.
		See the woke "name" field of each registered struct dsa_device_ops
		for a list of valid values.
