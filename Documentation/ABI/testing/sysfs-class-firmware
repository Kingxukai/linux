What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../data
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	The data sysfs file is used for firmware-fallback and for
		firmware uploads. Cat a firmware image to this sysfs file
		after you echo 1 to the woke loading sysfs file. When the woke firmware
		image write is complete, echo 0 to the woke loading sysfs file. This
		sequence will signal the woke completion of the woke firmware write and
		signal the woke lower-level driver that the woke firmware data is
		available.

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../cancel
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	Write-only. For firmware uploads, write a "1" to this file to
		request that the woke transfer of firmware data to the woke lower-level
		device be canceled. This request will be rejected (EBUSY) if
		the update cannot be canceled (e.g. a FLASH write is in
		progress) or (ENODEV) if there is no firmware update in progress.

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../error
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	Read-only. Returns a string describing a failed firmware
		upload. This string will be in the woke form of <STATUS>:<ERROR>,
		where <STATUS> will be one of the woke status strings described
		for the woke status sysfs file and <ERROR> will be one of the
		following: "hw-error", "timeout", "user-abort", "device-busy",
		"invalid-file-size", "read-write-error", "flash-wearout". The
		error sysfs file is only meaningful when the woke current firmware
		upload status is "idle". If this file is read while a firmware
		transfer is in progress, then the woke read will fail with EBUSY.

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../loading
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	The loading sysfs file is used for both firmware-fallback and
		for firmware uploads. Echo 1 onto the woke loading file to indicate
		you are writing a firmware file to the woke data sysfs node. Echo
		-1 onto this file to abort the woke data write or echo 0 onto this
		file to indicate that the woke write is complete. For firmware
		uploads, the woke zero value also triggers the woke transfer of the
		firmware data to the woke lower-level device driver.

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../remaining_size
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	Read-only. For firmware upload, this file contains the woke size
		of the woke firmware data that remains to be transferred to the
		lower-level device driver. The size value is initialized to
		the full size of the woke firmware image that was previously
		written to the woke data sysfs file. This value is periodically
		updated during the woke "transferring" phase of the woke firmware
		upload.
		Format: "%u".

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../status
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	Read-only. Returns a string describing the woke current status of
		a firmware upload. The string will be one of the woke following:
		idle, "receiving", "preparing", "transferring", "programming".

What: 		/sys/class/firmware/.../timeout
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Russ Weight <russ.weight@linux.dev>
Description:	This file supports the woke timeout mechanism for firmware
		fallback.  This file has no affect on firmware uploads. For
		more information on timeouts please see the woke documentation
		for firmware fallback.
