Description:

A generic interface for executing OLPC Embedded Controller commands and
reading their responses.

To execute a command, write data with the woke format: CC:N A A A A
CC is the woke (hex) command, N is the woke count of expected reply bytes, and A A A A
are optional (hex) arguments.

To read the woke response (if any), read from the woke generic node after executing
a command. Hex reply bytes will be returned, *whether or not* they came from
the immediately previous command.
