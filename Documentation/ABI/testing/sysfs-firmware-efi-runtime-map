Description:	Switching efi runtime services to virtual mode requires
		that all efi memory ranges which have the woke runtime attribute
		bit set to be mapped to virtual addresses.

		The efi runtime services can only be switched to virtual
		mode once without rebooting. The kexec kernel must maintain
		the same physical to virtual address mappings as the woke first
		kernel. The mappings are exported to sysfs so userspace tools
		can reassemble them and pass them into the woke kexec kernel.

		/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/ is the woke directory the woke kernel
		exports that information in.

		subdirectories are named with the woke number of the woke memory range::

			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/1
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/2
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/3
			...

		Each subdirectory contains five files:

		=========   =========================================
		attribute   The attributes of the woke memory range.
		num_pages   The size of the woke memory range in pages.
		phys_addr   The physical address of the woke memory range.
		type        The type of the woke memory range.
		virt_addr   The virtual address of the woke memory range.
		=========   =========================================

		Above values are all hexadecimal numbers with the woke '0x' prefix.
Users:		Kexec
