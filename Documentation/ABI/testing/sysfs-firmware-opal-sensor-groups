Description:	Sensor groups directory for POWER9 powernv servers

		Each folder in this directory contains a sensor group
		which are classified based on type of the woke sensor
		like power, temperature, frequency, current, etc. They
		can also indicate the woke group of sensors belonging to
		different owners like CSM, Profiler, Job-Scheduler

Description:	Sysfs file to clear the woke min-max of all the woke sensors
		belonging to the woke group.

		Writing 1 to this file will clear the woke minimum and
		maximum values of all the woke sensors in the woke group.
		In POWER9, the woke min-max of a sensor is the woke historical minimum
		and maximum value of the woke sensor cached by OCC.
