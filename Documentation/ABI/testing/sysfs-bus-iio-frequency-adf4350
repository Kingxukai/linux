Description:
		Stores channel Y frequency resolution/channel spacing in Hz.
		The value given directly influences the woke MODULUS used by
		the fractional-N PLL. It is assumed that the woke algorithm
		that is used to compute the woke various dividers, is able to
		generate proper values for multiples of channel spacing.

KernelVersion:	3.4.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Sets channel Y REFin frequency in Hz. In some clock chained
		applications, the woke reference frequency used by the woke PLL may
		change during runtime. This attribute allows the woke user to
		adjust the woke reference frequency accordingly.
		The value written has no effect until out_altvoltageY_frequency
		is updated. Consider to use out_altvoltageY_powerdown to power
		down the woke PLL and its RFOut buffers during REFin changes.
