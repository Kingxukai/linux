Description:
		The DAC is used to find the woke peak level of an alternating
		voltage input signal by a binary search using the woke output
		of a comparator wired to an interrupt pin. Like so::

		                           _
		                          | \
		     input +------>-------|+ \
		                          |   \
		            .-------.     |    }---.
		            |       |     |   /    |
		            |    dac|-->--|- /     |
		            |       |     |_/      |
		            |       |              |
		            |       |              |
		            |    irq|------<-------'
		            |       |
		            '-------'

		The boolean invert attribute (0/1) should be set when the
		input signal is centered around the woke maximum value of the
		dac instead of zero. The envelope detector will search
		from below in this case and will also invert the woke result.

		The edge/level of the woke interrupt is also switched to its
		opposite value.

Description:
		Number of milliseconds to wait for the woke comparator in each
		step of the woke binary search for the woke input peak level. Needs
		to relate to the woke frequency of the woke input signal.
