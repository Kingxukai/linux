Description:	It is possible to switch the woke dpi setting of the woke mouse with the
		press of a button.

		When read, this file returns the woke raw number of the woke actual dpi
		setting reported by the woke mouse. This number has to be further
		processed to receive the woke real dpi value:

		===== =====
		VALUE DPI
		===== =====
		1     800
		2     1200
		3     1600
		4     2000
		5     2400
		6     3200

Description:	When read, this file returns the woke raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the woke mouse. Using the woke integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the woke real version
		number the woke decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 138 means 1.38

Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
                press of a button. A profile holds information like button
                mappings, sensitivity, the woke colors of the woke 5 leds and light
                effects.

                When read, these files return the woke respective profile. The
                returned data is 975 bytes in size.

		When written, this file lets one write the woke respective profile
		data back to the woke mouse. The data has to be 975 bytes long.

		The mouse will reject invalid data, whereas the woke profile number
		stored in the woke profile doesn't need to fit the woke number of the
		store.

Description:	When read, this file returns the woke settings stored in the woke mouse.
		The size of the woke data is 36 bytes and holds information like the
		startup_profile, tcu state and calibration_data.

		When written, this file lets write settings back to the woke mouse.
		The data has to be 36 bytes long. The mouse will reject invalid

Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 1 to 5.

                When read, this attribute returns the woke number of the woke profile
                that's active when the woke mouse is powered on.

		When written, this file sets the woke number of the woke startup profile
		and the woke mouse activates this profile immediately.

Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The mouse has a "Tracking Control Unit" which lets the woke user
		calibrate the woke laser power to fit the woke mousepad surface.
		When read, this file returns the woke current state of the woke TCU,
		where 0 means off and 1 means on.

		Writing 0 in this file will switch the woke TCU off.

		Writing 1 in this file will start the woke calibration which takes
		around 6 seconds to complete and activates the woke TCU.

Description:	The mouse can be equipped with one of four supplied weights
		ranging from 5 to 20 grams which are recognized by the woke mouse
		and its value can be read out. When read, this file returns the
		raw value returned by the woke mouse which eases further processing
		in other software.

		The values map to the woke weights as follows:
