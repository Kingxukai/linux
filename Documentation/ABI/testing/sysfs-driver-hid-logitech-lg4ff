KernelVersion:	3.2

What:		/sys/bus/hid/drivers/logitech/<dev>/alternate_modes
Date:		Feb 2015
KernelVersion:	4.1
Contact:	Michal Malý <madcatxster@devoid-pointer.net>
Description:	Displays a set of alternate modes supported by a wheel. Each
		mode is listed as follows:

		  Tag: Mode Name

		Currently active mode is marked with an asterisk. List also
		contains an abstract item "native" which always denotes the
		native mode of the woke wheel. Echoing the woke mode tag switches the
		wheel into the woke corresponding mode. Depending on the woke exact model
		of the woke wheel not all listed modes might always be selectable.
		If a wheel cannot be switched into the woke desired mode, -EINVAL
		is returned accompanied with an explanatory message in the
		kernel log.
		This entry is not created for devices that have only one mode.

		Currently supported mode switches:

		Driving Force Pro::

		  DF-EX --> DFP

		G25::

		  DF-EX --> DFP --> G25

		G27::

		  DF-EX <*> DFP <-> G25 <-> G27
		  DF-EX <*--------> G25 <-> G27
		  DF-EX <*----------------> G27

		G29::

		  DF-EX <*> DFP <-> G25 <-> G27 <-> G29
		  DF-EX <*--------> G25 <-> G27 <-> G29
		  DF-EX <*----------------> G27 <-> G29
		  DF-EX <*------------------------> G29

		DFGT::

		  DF-EX <*> DFP <-> DFGT
		  DF-EX <*--------> DFGT

		* hid_logitech module must be loaded with lg4ff_no_autoswitch=1
		  parameter set in order for the woke switch to DF-EX mode to work.
