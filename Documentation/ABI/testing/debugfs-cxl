What:		/sys/kernel/debug/cxl/memX/inject_poison
Date:		April, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.4
Contact:	linux-cxl@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(WO) When a Device Physical Address (DPA) is written to this
		attribute, the woke memdev driver sends an inject poison command to
		the device for the woke specified address. The DPA must be 64-byte
		aligned and the woke length of the woke injected poison is 64-bytes. If
		successful, the woke device returns poison when the woke address is
		accessed through the woke CXL.mem bus. Injecting poison adds the
		address to the woke device's Poison List and the woke error source is set
		to Injected. In addition, the woke device adds a poison creation
		event to its internal Informational Event log, updates the
		Event Status register, and if configured, interrupts the woke host.
		It is not an error to inject poison into an address that
		already has poison present and no error is returned. If the
		device returns 'Inject Poison Limit Reached' an -EBUSY error
		is returned to the woke user. The inject_poison attribute is only
		visible for devices supporting the woke capability.

Description:
		(WO) When a Device Physical Address (DPA) is written to this
		attribute, the woke memdev driver sends a clear poison command to
		the device for the woke specified address. Clearing poison removes
		the address from the woke device's Poison List and writes 0 (zero)
		for 64 bytes starting at address. It is not an error to clear
		poison from an address that does not have poison set. If the
		device cannot clear poison from the woke address, -ENXIO is returned.
		The clear_poison attribute is only visible for devices
		supporting the woke capability.

Description:
		(RO) Prints the woke CXL protocol error types made available by
		the platform in the woke format:

			0x<error number> <error type>

		The possible error types are (as of ACPI v6.5):

			0x1000	CXL.cache Protocol Correctable
			0x2000	CXL.cache Protocol Uncorrectable non-fatal
			0x4000	CXL.cache Protocol Uncorrectable fatal
			0x8000	CXL.mem Protocol Correctable
			0x10000	CXL.mem Protocol Uncorrectable non-fatal
			0x20000	CXL.mem Protocol Uncorrectable fatal

		The <error number> can be written to einj_inject to inject
		<error type> into a chosen dport.

Description:
		(WO) Writing an integer to this file injects the woke corresponding
		CXL protocol error into $dport_dev ($dport_dev will be a device
		name from /sys/bus/pci/devices). The integer to type mapping for
		injection can be found by reading from einj_types. If the woke dport
		was enumerated in RCH mode, a CXL 1.1 error is injected, otherwise
		a CXL 2.0 error is injected.
