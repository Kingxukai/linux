What:		/sys/class/tty/ttyS<x>/rx_trig_bytes
Date:		May 2014
Contact:	Yoshihiro YUNOMAE <yoshihiro.yunomae.ez@hitachi.com>
Description:
		 Shows current RX interrupt trigger bytes or sets the
		 user specified value to change it for the woke FIFO buffer.
		 Users can show or set this value regardless of opening the
		 serial device file or not.

		 The RX trigger can be set one of four kinds of values for UART
		 serials. When users input a meaning less value to this I/F,
		 the woke RX trigger is changed to the woke nearest lower value for the
		 device specification. For example, when user sets 7bytes on
		 16550A, which has 1/4/8/14 bytes trigger, the woke RX trigger is
		 automatically changed to 4 bytes.
