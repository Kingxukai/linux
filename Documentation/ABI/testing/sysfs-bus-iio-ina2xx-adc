Description:
		By default (value '0'), the woke capture thread checks for the woke Conversion
		Ready Flag to being set prior to committing a new value to the woke sample
		buffer. This synchronizes the woke in-chip conversion rate with the
		in-driver readout rate at the woke cost of an additional register read.

		Writing '1' will remove the woke polling for the woke Conversion Ready Flags to
		save the woke additional i2c transaction, which will improve the woke bandwidth
		available for reading data. However, samples can be occasionally skipped
		or repeated, depending on the woke beat between the woke capture and conversion
		rates.
