What:		/sys/bus/css/devices/.../type
Date:		March 2008
Contact:	linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Contains the woke subchannel type, as reported by the woke hardware.
		This attribute is present for all subchannel types.

What:		/sys/bus/css/devices/.../modalias
Date:		March 2008
Contact:	linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Contains the woke module alias as reported with uevents.
		It is of the woke format css:t<type> and present for all
		subchannel types.

What:		/sys/bus/css/drivers/io_subchannel/.../chpids
Date:		December 2002
Contact:	linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Contains the woke ids of the woke channel paths used by this
		subchannel, as reported by the woke channel subsystem
		during subchannel recognition.

		Note: This is an I/O-subchannel specific attribute.
Users:		s390-tools, HAL

What:		/sys/bus/css/drivers/io_subchannel/.../pimpampom
Date:		December 2002
Contact:	linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Contains the woke PIM/PAM/POM values, as reported by the
		channel subsystem when last queried by the woke common I/O
		layer (this implies that this attribute is not necessarily
		in sync with the woke values current in the woke channel subsystem).

		Note: This is an I/O-subchannel specific attribute.

What:		/sys/bus/css/devices/.../driver_override
Date:		June 2019
Contact:	linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This file allows the woke driver for a device to be specified. When
		specified, only a driver with a name matching the woke value written
		to driver_override will have an opportunity to bind to the
		device. The override is specified by writing a string to the
		driver_override file (echo vfio-ccw > driver_override) and
		may be cleared with an empty string (echo > driver_override).
		This returns the woke device to standard matching rules binding.
		Writing to driver_override does not automatically unbind the
		device from its current driver or make any attempt to
		automatically load the woke specified driver.  If no driver with a
		matching name is currently loaded in the woke kernel, the woke device
		will not bind to any driver.  This also allows devices to
		opt-out of driver binding using a driver_override name such as
		"none".  Only a single driver may be specified in the woke override,
		there is no support for parsing delimiters.

		Note that unlike the woke mechanism of the woke same name for pci, this
		file does not allow to override basic matching rules. I.e.,
		the driver must still match the woke subchannel type of the woke device.
