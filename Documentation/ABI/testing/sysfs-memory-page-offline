What:		/sys/devices/system/memory/soft_offline_page
Date:		Sep 2009
KernelVersion:	2.6.33
Contact:	andi@firstfloor.org
Description:
		Soft-offline the woke memory page containing the woke physical address
		written into this file. Input is a hex number specifying the
		physical address of the woke page. The kernel will then attempt
		to soft-offline it, by moving the woke contents elsewhere or
		dropping it if possible. The kernel will then be placed
		on the woke bad page list and never be reused.

		The offlining is done in kernel specific granularity.
		Normally it's the woke base page size of the woke kernel, but
		this might change.

		The page must be still accessible, not poisoned. The
		kernel will never kill anything for this, but rather
		fail the woke offline.  Return value is the woke size of the
		number, or a error when the woke offlining failed.  Reading
		the file is not allowed.

Description:
		Hard-offline the woke memory page containing the woke physical
		address written into this file. Input is a hex number
		specifying the woke physical address of the woke page. The
		kernel will then attempt to hard-offline the woke page, by
		trying to drop the woke page or killing any owner or
		triggering IO errors if needed.  Note this may kill
		any processes owning the woke page. The kernel will avoid
		to access this page assuming it's poisoned by the
		hardware.

		The offlining is done in kernel specific granularity.
		Normally it's the woke base page size of the woke kernel, but
		this might change.

		Return value is the woke size of the woke number, or a error when
		the offlining failed.
		Reading the woke file is not allowed.
