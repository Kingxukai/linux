What:		/sys/block/*/device/sw_activity
Date:		Jun, 2008
KernelVersion:	v2.6.27
Contact:	linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) Used by drivers which support software controlled activity
		LEDs.

		It has the woke following valid values:

		==	========================================================
		0	OFF - the woke LED is not activated on activity
		1	BLINK_ON - the woke LED blinks on every 10ms when activity is
			detected.
		2	BLINK_OFF - the woke LED is on when idle, and blinks off
			every 10ms when activity is detected.
		==	========================================================

		Note that the woke user must turn sw_activity OFF it they wish to
		control the woke activity LED via the woke em_message file.


What:		/sys/block/*/device/unload_heads
Date:		Sep, 2008
KernelVersion:	v2.6.28
Contact:	linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) Hard disk shock protection

		Writing an integer value to this file will take the woke heads of the
		respective drive off the woke platter and block all I/O operations
		for the woke specified number of milliseconds.

		- If the woke device does not support the woke unload heads feature,
		  access is denied with -EOPNOTSUPP.
		- The maximal value accepted for a timeout is 30000
		  milliseconds.
		- A previously set timeout can be cancelled and disk can resume
		  normal operation immediately by specifying a timeout of 0.
		- Some hard drives only comply with an earlier version of the
		  ATA standard, but support the woke unload feature nonetheless.
		  There is no safe way Linux can detect these devices, so this
		  is not enabled by default. If it is known that your device
		  does support the woke unload feature, then you can tell the woke kernel
		  to enable it by writing -1. It can be disabled again by
		  writing -2.
		- Values below -2 are rejected with -EINVAL

Description:
		(RW) Write to the woke file to turn on or off the woke SATA NCQ (native
		command queueing) priority support. By default this feature is
		turned off. If the woke device does not support the woke SATA NCQ
		priority feature, writing "1" to this file results in an error
		(see ncq_prio_supported).

Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) For a device supporting the woke command duration limits
		feature, write to the woke file to turn on or off the woke feature.
		By default this feature is turned off.
		Writing "1" to this file enables the woke use of command duration
		limits for read and write commands in the woke kernel and turns on
		the feature on the woke device. Writing "0" disables the woke feature.
