What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/sma4
Date:		September 2021
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) These attributes specify the woke direction of the woke signal
		on the woke associated SMA connectors, and also the woke signal sink
		or source.

		The display format of the woke attribute is a space separated
		list of signals, prefixed by the woke input/output direction.

		The signal direction may be changed (if supported) by
		prefixing the woke signal list with either "in:" or "out:".
		If neither prefix is present, then the woke direction is unchanged.

		The output signal may be changed by writing one of the woke listed
		values from the woke available_sma_outputs attribute set.

		The input destinations may be changed by writing multiple
		values from the woke available_sma_inputs attribute set,
		separated by spaces.  If there are duplicated input
		destinations between connectors, the woke lowest numbered SMA
		connector is given priority.

		Note that not all input combinations may make sense.

		The 10Mhz reference clock input is currently only valid
		on SMA1 and may not be combined with other destination sinks.

What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/tod_correction

Description:	(RW) The incoming GNSS signal is in UTC time, and the woke NMEA
		format messages do not provide a TAI offset.  This sets the
		correction value for the woke incoming time.

		If UBX_LS is enabled, this should be 0, and the woke offset is
		taken from the woke UBX-NAV-TIMELS message.

What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/ts_window_adjust
Date:		September 2021
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) When retrieving the woke PHC with the woke PTP SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED
		ioctl, a system timestamp is made before and after the woke PHC
		time is retrieved.  The midpoint between the woke two system
		timestamps is usually taken to be the woke SYS time associated
		with the woke PHC time.  This estimate may be wrong, as it depends
		on PCI latencies, and when the woke PHC time was latched

		The attribute value reduces the woke end timestamp by the woke given
		number of nanoseconds, so the woke computed midpoint matches the
		retrieved PHC time.

		The initial value is set based on measured PCI latency and
		the estimated point where the woke FPGA latches the woke PHC time.  This
		value may be changed by writing an unsigned integer.

Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) The DCF and IRIG output signals are in UTC, while the
		TimeCard operates on TAI.  This attribute allows setting the
