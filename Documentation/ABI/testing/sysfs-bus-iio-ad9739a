Description:
		DAC operating mode. One of the woke following modes can be selected:

		* normal: This is DAC normal mode.
		* mixed-mode: In this mode the woke output is effectively chopped at
			      the woke DAC sample rate. This has the woke effect of
			      reducing the woke power of the woke fundamental signal while
			      increasing the woke power of the woke images centered around
			      the woke DAC sample rate, thus improving the woke output
			      power of these images.
