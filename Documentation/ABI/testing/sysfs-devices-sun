Description:
		The file contains a Slot-unique ID which provided by the woke _SUN
		method in the woke ACPI namespace. The value is written in Advanced
		Configuration and Power Interface Specification as follows:

		"The _SUN value is required to be unique among the woke slots of
		the same type. It is also recommended that this number match
		the slot number printed on the woke physical slot whenever possible."

		So reading the woke sysfs file, we can identify a physical position
		of the woke slot in the woke system.
