Description:
		This directory contains the woke details about the woke device that are
		assigned in kernel (i.e. software), as opposed to the
		firmware_node directory which contains the woke details that are
		assigned for the woke device in firmware. The main attributes in the
		directory will show the woke properties the woke device has, and the
		relationship it has to some of the woke other devices.
