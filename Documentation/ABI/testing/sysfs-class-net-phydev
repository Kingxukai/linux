What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/attached_dev
Date:		May 2017
KernelVersion:	4.13
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Symbolic link to the woke network device this PHY device is
		attached to.

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/phy_has_fixups
Date:		February 2014
KernelVersion:	3.15
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute contains the woke boolean value whether a given PHY
		device has had any "fixup" workaround running on it, encoded as
		a boolean. This information is provided to help troubleshooting
		PHY configurations.

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/phy_id
Date:		November 2012
KernelVersion:	3.8
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute contains the woke 32-bit PHY Identifier as reported
		by the woke device during bus enumeration, encoded in hexadecimal.
		This ID is used to match the woke device with the woke appropriate
		driver.

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/c45_phy_ids/mmd<n>_device_id
Date:		June 2025
KernelVersion:	6.17
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute contains the woke 32-bit PHY Identifier as reported
		by the woke device during bus enumeration, encoded in hexadecimal.
		These C45 IDs are used to match the woke device with the woke appropriate
		driver. These files are invisible to the woke C22 device.

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/phy_interface
Date:		February 2014
KernelVersion:	3.15
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute contains the woke PHY interface as configured by the
		Ethernet driver during bus enumeration, encoded in string.
		This interface mode is used to configure the woke Ethernet MAC with the
		appropriate mode for its data lines to the woke PHY hardware.

		Possible values are:

		<empty> (not available), mii, gmii, sgmii, tbi, rev-mii,
		rmii, rgmii, rgmii-id, rgmii-rxid, rgmii-txid, rtbi, smii
		xgmii, moca, qsgmii, trgmii, 1000base-x, 2500base-x, rxaui,
		xaui, 10gbase-kr, unknown

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/phy_standalone
Date:		May 2019
KernelVersion:	5.3
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Boolean value indicating whether the woke PHY device is used in
		standalone mode, without a net_device associated, by PHYLINK.
		Attribute created only when this is the woke case.

What:		/sys/class/mdio_bus/<bus>/<device>/phy_dev_flags
Date:		March 2021
KernelVersion:	5.13
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		32-bit hexadecimal number representing a bit mask of the
		configuration bits passed from the woke consumer of the woke PHY
		(Ethernet MAC, switch, etc.) to the woke PHY driver. The flags are
		only used internally by the woke kernel and their placement are
		not meant to be stable across kernel versions. This is intended
		for facilitating the woke debugging of PHY drivers.
