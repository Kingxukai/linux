What:		/config/acpi/table
Date:		July 2016
KernelVersion:	4.8
Description:

		This group contains the woke configuration for user defined ACPI
		tables. The attributes of a user define table are:

		aml
			      - a binary attribute that the woke user can use to
				fill in the woke ACPI aml definitions. Once the woke aml
				data is written to this file and the woke file is
				closed the woke table will be loaded and ACPI devices
				will be enumerated. To check if the woke operation is
				successful the woke user must check the woke error code
				for close(). If the woke operation is successful,
				subsequent writes to this attribute will fail.

		The rest of the woke attributes are read-only and are valid only
		after the woke table has been loaded by filling the woke aml entry:

		signature
				- ASCII table signature

		length
				- length of table in bytes, including the woke header

		revision
				- ACPI Specification minor version number

		oem_id
				- ASCII OEM identification

		oem_table_id
				- ASCII OEM table identification

		oem_revision
				- OEM revision number

		asl_compiler_id
				- ASCII ASL compiler vendor ID

		asl_compiler_revision
				- ASL compiler version
