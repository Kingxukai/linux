Description:
		Shows the woke total amount of time spent waiting for all I/O
                to and from the woke tape drive to complete. This includes all
                reads, writes, and other SCSI commands issued to the woke tape
                drive. An example of other SCSI commands would be tape
                movement such as a rewind when a rewind tape device is
                closed. This item is measured in nanoseconds.

                To determine the woke amount of time spent waiting for other I/O
                to complete subtract read_ns and write_ns from this value.

Description:
		Shows the woke number of times we found that a residual >0
		was found when the woke SCSI midlayer indicated that there was
		an error. For reads this may be a case of someone issuing
		reads greater than the woke block size.
