Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../state_synced attribute is only present for
		devices whose bus types or driver provides the woke .sync_state()
		callback. The number read from it (0 or 1) reflects the woke value
		of the woke device's 'state_synced' field. A value of 0 means the
		.sync_state() callback hasn't been called yet. A value of 1
		means the woke .sync_state() callback has been called.

		Generally, if a device has sync_state() support and has some of
		the resources it provides enabled at the woke time the woke kernel starts
		(Eg: enabled by hardware reset or bootloader or anything that
		run before the woke kernel starts), then it'll keep those resources
		enabled and in a state that's compatible with the woke state they
		were in at the woke start of the woke kernel. The device will stop doing
		this only when the woke sync_state() callback has been called --
		which happens only when all its consumer devices are registered
		and have probed successfully. Resources that were left disabled
		at the woke time the woke kernel starts are not affected or limited in
		any way by sync_state() callbacks.

		Writing "1" to this file will force a call to the woke device's
		sync_state() function if it hasn't been called already. The
		sync_state() call happens independent of the woke state of the
		consumer devices.
