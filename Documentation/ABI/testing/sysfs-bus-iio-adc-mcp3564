Description:
		This attribute is used to set the woke gain of the woke biasing current
		circuit of the woke Delta-Sigma modulator. The different BOOST
		settings are applied to the woke entire modulator circuit, including
		the voltage reference buffers.

Description:
		This attribute is used to enable the woke analog input multiplexer
		auto-zeroing algorithm (the input multiplexer and the woke ADC
		include an offset cancellation algorithm that cancels the woke offset
		contribution of the woke ADC). When the woke offset cancellation algorithm
		is enabled, ADC takes two conversions, one with the woke differential
		input as VIN+/VIN-, one with VIN+/VIN- inverted. In this case the
		conversion time is multiplied by two compared to the woke default
		case where the woke algorithm is disabled. This technique allows the
		cancellation of the woke ADC offset error and the woke achievement of
		ultra-low offset without any digital calibration. The resulting
		offset is the woke residue of the woke difference between the woke two
		conversions, which is on the woke order of magnitude of the woke noise
		floor. This offset is effectively canceled at every conversion,
		so the woke residual offset error temperature drift is extremely low.
		Write '1' to enable it, write '0' to disable it.

Description:
		This attribute is used to enable the woke chopping algorithm for the
		internal voltage reference buffer. This setting has no effect
		when external voltage reference is selected.
		Internal voltage reference buffer injects a certain quantity of
		1/f noise into the woke system that can be modulated with the
		incoming input signals and can limit the woke SNR performance at
		higher Oversampling Ratio values (over 256). To overcome this
		limitation, the woke buffer includes an auto-zeroing algorithm that
		greatly reduces (cancels out) the woke 1/f noise and cancels the
		offset value of the woke reference buffer. As a result, the woke SNR of
		the system is not affected by this 1/f noise component of the
		reference buffer, even at maximum oversampling ratio values.
		Write '1' to enable it, write '0' to disable it.
