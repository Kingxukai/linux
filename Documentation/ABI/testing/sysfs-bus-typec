Description:
		Shows if the woke mode is active or not. The attribute can be used
		for entering/exiting the woke mode. Entering/exiting modes is
		supported as synchronous operation so write(2) to the woke attribute
		does not return until the woke enter/exit mode operation has
		finished. The attribute is notified when the woke mode is
		entered/exited so poll(2) on the woke attribute wakes up.
		Entering/exiting a mode will also generate uevent KOBJ_CHANGE.

		Valid values are boolean.

Description:
		The index number of the woke mode returned by Discover Modes USB
		Power Delivery command. Depending on the woke alternate mode, the
		mode index may be significant.

		With some alternate modes (SVIDs), the woke mode index is assigned
		for specific functionality in the woke specification for that
		alternate mode.

		With other alternate modes, the woke mode index values are not
		assigned, and can not be therefore used for identification. When
		the mode index is not assigned, identifying the woke alternate mode
		must be done with either mode VDO or the woke description.
