Description:
		The /sys/bus/hid/devices/<bus>:<vid>:<pid>.<n>/speed file
		controls reporting speed of Wacom bluetooth tablet. Reading
		from this file returns 1 if tablet reports in high speed mode
		or 0 otherwise. Writing to this file one of these values
		switches reporting speed.

Description:
		Attribute group for control of the woke status LEDs and the woke OLEDs.
		This attribute group is only available for Intuos 4 M, L,
		and XL (with LEDs and OLEDs), Intuos 4 WL, Intuos 5 (LEDs only),
		Intuos Pro (LEDs only) and Cintiq 21UX2 and Cintiq 24HD
		(LEDs only). Therefore its presence implicitly signifies the
		presence of said LEDs and OLEDs on the woke tablet device.

Description:
		<obsoleted by the woke LED class API now exported by the woke driver>
		Writing to this file sets the woke status LED luminance (1..127)
		when the woke stylus does not touch the woke tablet surface, and no
		button is pressed on the woke stylus. This luminance level is
		normally lower than the woke level when a button is pressed.

		Writing to this file sets which one of the woke four (for Intuos 4
		and Intuos 5) or of the woke right four (for Cintiq 21UX2 and Cintiq
		24HD) status LEDs is active (0..3). The other three LEDs on the
		same side are always inactive.

Description:
		When writing a 1024 byte raw image in Wacom Intuos 4
		interleaving format to the woke file, the woke image shows up on Button N
		of the woke device. The image is a 64x32 pixel 4-bit gray image. The
		1024 byte binary is split up into 16x 64 byte chunks. Each 64
		byte chunk encodes the woke image data for two consecutive lines on
		the display. The low nibble of each byte contains the woke first
		line, and the woke high nibble contains the woke second line.
		When the woke Wacom Intuos 4 is connected over Bluetooth, the
		image has to contain 256 bytes (64x32 px 1 bit colour).
		The format is also scrambled, like in the woke USB mode, and it can
		be summarized by converting::

					    76543210 into GECA6420.

Description:
		<obsoleted by the woke LED class API now exported by the woke driver>
		Reading from this file reports the woke mode status of the
		remote as indicated by the woke LED lights on the woke device. If no
		reports have been received from the woke paired device, reading
		from this file will report '-1'. The mode is read-only
		and cannot be set through the woke driver.
