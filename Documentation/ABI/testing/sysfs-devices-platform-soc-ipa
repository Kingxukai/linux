What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/ directory contains
		attributes that define IDs associated with IPA
		endpoints.  The "rx" or "tx" in an endpoint name is
		from the woke perspective of the woke AP.  An endpoint ID is a
		small unsigned integer.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_rx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_rx file contains
		the ID of the woke AP endpoint on which packets originating
		from the woke embedded modem are received.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_tx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_tx file contains
		the ID of the woke AP endpoint on which packets destined
		for the woke embedded modem are sent.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/monitor_rx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/monitor_rx file contains
		the ID of the woke AP endpoint on which IPA "monitor" data is
		received.  The monitor endpoint supplies replicas of
		packets that enter the woke IPA hardware for processing.
		Each replicated packet is preceded by a fixed-size "ODL"
		header (see .../XXXXXXX.ipa/feature/monitor, above).
		Large packets are truncated, to reduce the woke bandwidth
		required to provide the woke monitor function.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/modem/
