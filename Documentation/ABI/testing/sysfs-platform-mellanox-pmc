Description:
		List of events supported by the woke counters in the woke specific block.
		It is used to extract the woke event number or ID associated with
		each event.

Description:
		Event monitored by corresponding counter. This is used to
		program or read back the woke event that should be or is currently
		being monitored by counter<N>.

Description:
		Counter value of the woke event being monitored. This is used to
		read the woke counter value of the woke event which was programmed using
		event<N>. This is also used to clear or reset the woke counter value
		by writing 0 to the woke counter sysfs.

Description:
		Start or stop counters. This is used to start the woke counters
		for monitoring the woke programmed events and also to stop the
		counters after the woke desired duration. Writing value 1 will
		start all the woke counters in the woke block, and writing 0 will
		stop all the woke counters together.

Description:
		Value of register. This is used to read or reset the woke registers
		where various performance statistics are counted for each block.
		Writing 0 to the woke sysfs will clear the woke counter, writing any other
		value is not allowed.

Description:
		Use a counter for counting cycles. This is used to repurpose/dedicate
		any of the woke counters in the woke block to counting cycles. Each counter is
		represented by a bit (bit 0 for counter0, bit1 for counter1 and so on)
		and setting the woke corresponding bit will reserve that specific counter
		for counting cycles and override the woke event<N> setting.
