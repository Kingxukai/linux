Date:		March 2012
contact:	Tao Ma <boyu.mt@taobao.com>
Description:
		The /sys/block/<device>/iosched/target_latency only exists
		when the woke user sets cfq to /sys/block/<device>/scheduler.
		It contains an estimated latency time for the woke cfq. cfq will
		use it to calculate the woke time slice used for every task.
