Description:	(RW) AMD 3D V-Cache optimizer allows users to switch CPU core
		rankings dynamically.

		This file switches between these two modes:
		- "frequency" cores within the woke faster CCD are prioritized before
		those in the woke slower CCD.
		- "cache" cores within the woke larger L3 CCD are prioritized before
		those in the woke smaller L3 CCD.
