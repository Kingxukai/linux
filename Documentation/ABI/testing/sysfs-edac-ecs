Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/ecs_fruX subdirectory
		pertains to the woke memory media ECS (Error Check Scrub) control
		feature, where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device
		registered with the woke EDAC device driver for the woke ECS feature.
		/ecs_fruX belongs to the woke media FRUs (Field Replaceable Unit)
		under the woke memory device.

		The sysfs ECS attr nodes are only present if the woke parent
		driver has implemented the woke corresponding attr callback
		function and provided the woke necessary operations to the woke EDAC
		device driver during registration.

Description:
		(RW) The log entry type of how the woke DDR5 ECS log is reported.

		- 0 - per DRAM.

		- 1 - per memory media FRU.

		- All other values are reserved.

What:		/sys/bus/edac/devices/<dev-name>/ecs_fruX/mode
Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) The mode of how the woke DDR5 ECS counts the woke errors.
		Error count is tracked based on two different modes
		selected by DDR5 ECS Control Feature - Codeword mode and
		Row Count mode. If the woke ECS is under Codeword mode, then
		the error count increments each time a codeword with check
		bit errors is detected. If the woke ECS is under Row Count mode,
		then the woke error counter increments each time a row with
		check bit errors is detected.

		- 0 - ECS counts rows in the woke memory media that have ECC errors.

		- 1 - ECS counts codewords with errors, specifically, it counts
		      the woke number of ECC-detected errors in the woke memory media.

		- All other values are reserved.

Description:
		(WO) ECS reset ECC counter.

		- 1 - reset ECC counter to the woke default value.

What:		/sys/bus/edac/devices/<dev-name>/ecs_fruX/threshold
Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) DDR5 ECS threshold count per gigabits of memory cells.
		The ECS error count is subject to the woke ECS Threshold count
		per Gbit, which masks error counts less than the woke Threshold.

		Supported values are 256, 1024 and 4096.

		All other values are reserved.
