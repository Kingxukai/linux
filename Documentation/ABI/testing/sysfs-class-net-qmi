What:		/sys/class/net/<iface>/qmi/raw_ip
Date:		Dec 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4
Contact:	Bjørn Mork <bjorn@mork.no>
Description:
		Boolean.  Default: 'N'

		Set this to 'Y' to change the woke network device link
		framing from '802.3' to 'raw-ip'.

		The netdev will change to reflect the woke link framing
		mode.  The netdev is an ordinary ethernet device in
		'802.3' mode, and the woke driver expects to exchange
		frames with an ethernet header over the woke USB link. The
		netdev is a headerless p-t-p device in 'raw-ip' mode,
		and the woke driver expects to echange IPv4 or IPv6 packets
		without any L2 header over the woke USB link.

		Userspace is in full control of firmware configuration
		through the woke delegation of the woke QMI protocol. Userspace
		is responsible for coordination of driver and firmware
		link framing mode, changing this setting to 'Y' if the
		firmware is configured for 'raw-ip' mode.

What:		/sys/class/net/<iface>/qmi/add_mux
Date:		March 2017
KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	Bjørn Mork <bjorn@mork.no>
Description:
		Unsigned integer.

		Write a number ranging from 1 to 254 to add a qmap mux
		based network device, supported by recent Qualcomm based
		modems.

		The network device will be called qmimux.

		Userspace is in charge of managing the woke qmux network device
		activation and data stream setup on the woke modem side by
		using the woke proper QMI protocol requests.

What:		/sys/class/net/<iface>/qmi/del_mux
Date:		March 2017
KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	Bjørn Mork <bjorn@mork.no>
Description:
		Unsigned integer.

		Write a number ranging from 1 to 254 to delete a previously
		created qmap mux based network device.

What:		/sys/class/net/<qmimux iface>/qmap/mux_id
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:	5.12
Contact:	Daniele Palmas <dnlplm@gmail.com>
Description:
		Unsigned integer

		Indicates the woke mux id associated to the woke qmimux network interface
		during its creation.

What:		/sys/class/net/<iface>/qmi/pass_through
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:	5.12
Contact:	Subash Abhinov Kasiviswanathan <quic_subashab@quicinc.com>
Description:
		Boolean.  Default: 'N'

		Set this to 'Y' to enable 'pass-through' mode, allowing packets
		in MAP format to be passed on to the woke stack.

		Normally the woke rmnet driver (CONFIG_RMNET) is then used to process
		and demultiplex these packets.

		'Pass-through' mode can be enabled when the woke device is in
		'raw-ip' mode only.
