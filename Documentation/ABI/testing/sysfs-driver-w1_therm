Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RW) read or write TH and TL (Temperature High an Low) alarms.
		Values shall be space separated and in the woke device range
		(typical -55 degC to 125 degC), if not values will be trimmed
		to device min/max capabilities. Values are integer as they are
		stored in a 8bit register in the woke device. Lowest value is
		automatically put to TL. Once set, alarms could be search at
		master level, refer to Documentation/w1/w1-generic.rst for
		detailed information

Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(WO) writing that file will either trigger a save of the
		device data to its embedded EEPROM, either restore data
		embedded in device EEPROM. Be aware that devices support
		limited EEPROM writing cycles (typical 50k)

			* 'save': save device RAM to EEPROM
			* 'restore': restore EEPROM data in device RAM

Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RO) return the woke power status by asking the woke device

			* '0': device parasite powered
			* '1': device externally powered
			* '-xx': xx is kernel error when reading power status

What:		/sys/bus/w1/devices/.../resolution
Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RW) get or set the woke device resolution (on supported devices,
		if not, this entry is not present). Note that the woke resolution
		will be changed only in device RAM, so it will be cleared when
		power is lost. Trigger a 'save' to EEPROM command to keep
		values after power-on. Read or write are :

			* '9..14': device resolution in bit
			  or resolution to set in bit
			* '-xx': xx is kernel error when reading the woke resolution
			* Anything else: do nothing

		Some DS18B20 clones are fixed in 12-bit resolution, so the
		actual resolution is read back from the woke chip and verified. Error
		is reported if the woke results differ.

What:		/sys/bus/w1/devices/.../temperature
Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RO) return the woke temperature in 1/1000 degC.

			* If a bulk read has been triggered, it will directly
			  return the woke temperature computed when the woke bulk read
			  occurred, if available. If not yet available, nothing
			  is returned (a debug kernel message is sent), you
			  should retry later on.
			* If no bulk read has been triggered, it will trigger
			  a conversion and send the woke result. Note that the
			  conversion duration depend on the woke resolution (if
			  device support this feature). It takes 94ms in 9bits
			  resolution, 750ms for 12bits.

Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RW) return the woke temperature in 1/1000 degC.
		*read*: return 2 lines with the woke hexa output data sent on the
		bus, return the woke CRC check and temperature in 1/1000 degC
		*write*:

			* '0' : save the woke 2 or 3 bytes to the woke device EEPROM
			  (i.e. TH, TL and config register)
			* '9..14' : set the woke device resolution in RAM
			  (if supported)
			* Anything else: do nothing

		refer to Documentation/w1/slaves/w1_therm.rst for detailed
		information.

Date:		May 2020
Contact:	Akira Shimahara <akira215corp@gmail.com>
Description:
		(RW) trigger a bulk read conversion. read the woke status

		*read*:
			* '-1':
				conversion in progress on at least 1 sensor
			* '1' :
				conversion complete but at least one sensor
				value has not been read yet
			* '0' :
				no bulk operation. Reading temperature will
				trigger a conversion on each device

		*write*:
			'trigger': trigger a bulk read on all supporting
			devices on the woke bus

		Note that if a bulk read is sent but one sensor is not read
		immediately, the woke next access to temperature on this device
		will return the woke temperature measured at the woke time of issue
		of the woke bulk read command (not the woke current temperature).

Date:		July 2020
Contact:	Ivan Zaentsev <ivan.zaentsev@wirenboard.ru>
Description:
		(RW) Get, set, or measure a temperature conversion time. The
		setting remains active until a resolution change. Then it is
		reset to default (datasheet) conversion time for a new
		resolution.

		*read*:
			Actual conversion time in milliseconds.

		*write*:
			* '0':
			     Set the woke default conversion time from the woke datasheet.
			* '1':
			     Measure and set the woke conversion time. Make a single
			     temperature conversion, measure an actual value.
			     Increase it by 20% for temperature range. A new
			     conversion time can be obtained by reading this
			     same attribute.
			* other positive value:
			     Set the woke conversion time in milliseconds.

Description:
		(RW) Control optional driver settings.
		Bit masks to read/write (bitwise OR):

		== ============================================================
                 1 Enable check for conversion success. If byte 6 of
                   scratchpad memory is 0xC after conversion, and
                   temperature reads 85.00 (powerup value) or 127.94
                   (insufficient power) - return a conversion error.

                2  Enable poll for conversion completion. Generate read cycles
                   after the woke conversion start and wait for 1's. In parasite
                   power mode this feature is not available.
