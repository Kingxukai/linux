Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 0-4.
                When read, this attribute returns the woke number of the woke actual
                profile. This value is persistent, so its equivalent to the
                profile that's active when the woke mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, this file sets the woke number of the woke startup profile
		and the woke mouse activates this profile immediately.

Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	When read, this file returns the woke raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the woke mouse. Using the woke integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the woke real version
		number the woke decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 121 means 1.21
		This file is readonly.
		Please read binary attribute info which contains firmware version.

		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the woke profile number
		contained in the woke data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
