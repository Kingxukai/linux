Date:		December 2012
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. actual_profile holds number of actual profile.
		This value is persistent, so its value determines the woke profile
		that's active when the woke mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, the woke mouse activates the woke set profile immediately.
		The data has to be 3 bytes long.
		The mouse will reject invalid data.

Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. A profile is split in settings and buttons.
		profile_buttons holds information about button layout.
		When written, this file lets one write the woke respective profile
		buttons back to the woke mouse. The data has to be 59 bytes long.
		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the woke profile number
		contained in the woke data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
