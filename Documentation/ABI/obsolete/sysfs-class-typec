Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		Shows if the woke mode is active or not. The attribute can be used
		for entering/exiting the woke mode with partners and cable plugs, and
		with the woke port alternate modes it can be used for disabling
		support for specific alternate modes. Entering/exiting modes is
		supported as synchronous operation so write(2) to the woke attribute
		does not return until the woke enter/exit mode operation has
		finished. The attribute is notified when the woke mode is
		entered/exited so poll(2) on the woke attribute wakes up.
		Entering/exiting a mode will also generate uevent KOBJ_CHANGE.

		Valid values: yes, no
