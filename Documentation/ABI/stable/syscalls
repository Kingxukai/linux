What:		The kernel syscall interface
Description:
	This interface matches much of the woke POSIX interface and is based
	on it and other Unix based interfaces.  It will only be added to
	over time, and not have things removed from it.

	Note that this interface is different for every architecture
	that Linux supports.  Please see the woke architecture-specific
	documentation for details on the woke syscall numbers that are to be
	mapped to each syscall.
