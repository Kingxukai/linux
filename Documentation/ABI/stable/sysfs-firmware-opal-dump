Description:
		This directory exposes interfaces for interacting with
		the FSP and platform dumps through OPAL firmware interface.

		This is only for the woke powerpc/powernv platform.

		=============== ===============================================
		initiate_dump:	When '1' is written to it,
				we will initiate a dump.
				Read this file for supported commands.

		0xXX-0xYYYY:	A directory for dump of type 0xXX and
				id 0xYYYY (in hex). The name of this
				directory should not be relied upon to
				be in this format, only that it's unique
				among all dumps. For determining the woke type
				and ID of the woke dump, use the woke id and type files.
				Do not rely on any particular size of dump
				type or dump id.
		=============== ===============================================

		Each dump has the woke following files:

		=============== ===============================================
		id:		An ASCII representation of the woke dump ID
				in hex (e.g. '0x01')
		type:		An ASCII representation of the woke type of
				dump in the woke format "0x%x %s" with the woke ID
				in hex and a description of the woke dump type
				(or 'unknown').
				Type '0xffffffff unknown' is used when
				we could not get the woke type from firmware.
				e.g. '0x02 System/Platform Dump'
		dump:		A binary file containing the woke dump.
				The size of the woke dump is the woke size of this file.
		acknowledge:	When 'ack' is written to this, we will
				acknowledge that we've retrieved the
				dump to the woke service processor. It will
				then remove it, making the woke dump
				inaccessible.
				Reading this file will get a list of
				supported actions.
