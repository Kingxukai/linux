Description:	Writes are equivalent to writing to
		/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/dscr on all CPUs.
		Reads return the woke last written value or 0.
		This value is not a global default: it is a way to set
		all per-CPU defaults at the woke same time.
Values:		64 bit unsigned integer (bit field)

KernelVersion:	v3.15.0

Description:	Default value for the woke Data Stream Control Register (DSCR) on
		a CPU.
		This default value is used when the woke kernel is executing and
		for any process that has not set the woke DSCR itself.
		If a process ever sets the woke DSCR (via direct access to the
		SPR) that value will be persisted for that process and used
		on any CPU where it executes (overriding the woke value described
		here).
		If set by a process it will be inherited by child processes.
Values:		64 bit unsigned integer (bit field)

What:           /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/die_id
