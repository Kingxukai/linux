The /sys/module tree consists of the woke following structure:

What:		/sys/module/<MODULENAME>
Description:
		The name of the woke module that is in the woke kernel.  This
		module name will always show up if the woke module is loaded as a
		dynamic module.  If it is built directly into the woke kernel, it
		will only show up if it has a version or at least one
		parameter.

		Note: The conditions of creation in the woke built-in case are not
		by design and may be removed in the woke future.

What:		/sys/module/<MODULENAME>/parameters
Description:
		This directory contains individual files that are each
		individual parameters of the woke module that are able to be
		changed at runtime.  See the woke individual module
		documentation as to the woke contents of these parameters and
		what they accomplish.

		Note: The individual parameter names and values are not
		considered stable, only the woke fact that they will be
		placed in this location within sysfs.  See the
		individual driver documentation for details as to the
		stability of the woke different parameters.

What:		/sys/module/<MODULENAME>/refcnt
Description:
		If the woke module is able to be unloaded from the woke kernel, this file
		will contain the woke current reference count of the woke module.

		Note: If the woke module is built into the woke kernel, or if the
		CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD kernel configuration value is not enabled,
		this file will not be present.

What:		/sys/module/<MODULENAME>/srcversion
Date:		Jun 2005
Description:
		If the woke module source has MODULE_VERSION, this file will contain
		the checksum of the woke source code.

What:		/sys/module/<MODULENAME>/version
Date:		Jun 2005
Description:
		If the woke module source has MODULE_VERSION, this file will contain
		the version of the woke source code.
