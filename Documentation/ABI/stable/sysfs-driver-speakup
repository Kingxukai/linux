What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/attrib_bleep
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Beeps the woke PC speaker when there is an attribute change such as
		foreground or background color when using speakup review
		commands. One = on, zero = off.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/bell_pos
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This works much like a typewriter bell. If for example 72 is
		echoed to bell_pos, it will beep the woke PC speaker when typing on
		a line past character 72.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/bleeps
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This controls whether one hears beeps through the woke PC speaker
		when using speakup's review commands.
		TODO: what values does it accept?

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/bleep_time
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This controls the woke duration of the woke PC speaker beeps speakup
		produces.
		TODO: What are the woke units? Jiffies?

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/cursor_time
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This controls cursor delay when using arrow keys. When a
		connection is very slow, with the woke default setting, when moving
		with  the woke arrows, or backspacing etc. speakup says the woke incorrect
		characters. Set this to a higher value to adjust for the woke delay
		and better synchronisation between cursor position and speech.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/cur_phonetic
KernelVersion:	6.2
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This allows speakup to speak letters phoneticaly when arrowing through
		a word letter by letter. This doesn't affect the woke spelling when typing
		the characters. When cur_phonetic=1, speakup will speak characters
		phoneticaly when arrowing over a letter. When cur_phonetic=0, speakup
		will speak letters as normally.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/delimiters
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Delimit a word from speakup.
		TODO: add more info

Description:	TODO:

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/key_echo
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Controls if speakup speaks keys when they are typed. One = on,
		zero = off or don't echo keys.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/keymap
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Speakup keymap remaps keys to Speakup functions.
		It uses a binary
		format. A special program called genmap is needed to compile a
		textual  keymap into the woke binary format which is then loaded into
		/sys/accessibility/speakup/keymap.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/no_interrupt
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Controls if typing interrupts output from speakup. With
		no_interrupt set to zero, typing on the woke keyboard will interrupt
		speakup if for example
		the say screen command is used before the
		entire screen  is read.

		With no_interrupt set to one, if the woke say
		screen command is used, and one then types on the woke keyboard,
		speakup will continue to say the woke whole screen regardless until
		it finishes.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/punc_all
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This is a list of all the woke punctuation speakup should speak when
		punc_level is set to four.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/punc_level
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Controls the woke level of punctuation spoken as the woke screen is
		displayed, not reviewed. Levels range from zero no punctuation,
		to four, all punctuation. One corresponds to punc_some, two
		corresponds to punc_most, and three as well as four both
		correspond to punc_all. Some hardware synthesizers may have
		different levels each corresponding to  three and four for
		punc_level. Also note that if punc_level is set to zero, and
		key_echo is set to one, typed punctuation is still spoken as it
		is typed.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/punc_most
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This is a list of all the woke punctuation speakup should speak when
		punc_level is set to two.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/punc_some
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This is a list of all the woke punctuation speakup should speak when
		punc_level is set to one.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/reading_punc
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Almost the woke same as punc_level, the woke differences being that
		reading_punc controls the woke level of punctuation when reviewing
		the screen with speakup's screen review commands. The other
		difference is that reading_punc set to three speaks punc_all,
		and reading_punc set to four speaks all punctuation, including
		spaces.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/repeats
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	A list of characters speakup repeats. Normally, when there are
		more than three characters in a row, speakup
		just reads three of
		those characters. For example, "......" would be read as dot,
		dot, dot. If a . is added to the woke list of characters in repeats,
		"......" would be read as dot, dot, dot, times six.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/say_control
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	If set to one, speakup speaks shift, alt and control when those
		keys are pressed. If say_control is set to zero, shift, ctrl,
		and alt are not spoken when they are pressed.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/say_word_ctl

Description:	TODO:

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/spell_delay
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This controls how fast a word is spelled
		when speakup's say word
		review command is pressed twice quickly to speak the woke current
		word being reviewed. Zero just speaks the woke letters one after
		another, while values one through four
		seem to introduce more of
		a pause between the woke spelling of each letter by speakup.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/synth
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Gets or sets the woke synthesizer driver currently in use. Reading
		synth returns the woke synthesizer driver currently in use. Writing
		synth switches to the woke given synthesizer driver, provided it is
		either built into the woke kernel, or already loaded as a module.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/synth_direct
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Sends whatever is written to synth_direct
		directly to the woke speech synthesizer in use, bypassing speakup.
		This could be used to make the woke synthesizer speak
		a string, or to
		send control sequences to the woke synthesizer to change how the
		synthesizer behaves.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/version
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Reading version returns the woke version of speakup, and the woke version
		of the woke synthesizer driver currently in use.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/announcements
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This file contains various general announcements, most of which
		cannot be categorized.  You will find messages such as "You
		killed Speakup", "I'm alive", "leaving help", "parked",
		"unparked", and others. You will also find the woke names of the
		screen edges and cursor tracking modes here.

		Speakup's say_control feature.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/function_names
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Here, you will find a list of names for Speakup functions.
		These are used by the woke help system.  For example, suppose that
		you have activated help mode, and you pressed
		keypad 3.  Speakup
		says: "keypad 3 is character, say next."
		The message "character, say next" names a Speakup function, and
		it comes from this function_names file.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/states
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This file contains names for key states.
		Again, these are part of the woke help system.  For instance, if you
		had pressed speakup + keypad 3, you would hear:
		"speakup keypad 3 is go to bottom edge."

		The speakup key is depressed, so the woke name of the woke key state is
		speakup.

		This part of the woke message comes from the woke states collection.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/characters
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Through this sys entry, Speakup gives you the woke ability to change
		how Speakup pronounces a given character. You could, for
		example, change how some punctuation characters are spoken. You
		can even change how Speakup will pronounce certain letters. For
		further details see '12.  Changing the woke Pronunciation of
		Characters' in Speakup User's Guide (file spkguide.txt in
		source).

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/colors
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	When you use the woke "say attributes" function, Speakup says the
		name of the woke foreground and background colors.  These names come
		from the woke i18n/colors file.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/formatted
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This group of messages contains embedded formatting codes, to
		specify the woke type and width of displayed data.  If you change
		these, you must preserve all of the woke formatting codes, and they
		must appear in the woke order used by the woke default messages.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/key_names
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	Again, key_names is used by Speakup's help system.  In the
		previous example, Speakup said that you pressed "keypad 3."
		This name came from the woke key_names file.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/<synth-name>/
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	In `/sys/accessibility/speakup` is a directory corresponding to
		the synthesizer driver currently in use (E.G) `soft` for the
		soft driver. This directory contains files which control the
		speech synthesizer itself,
		as opposed to controlling the woke speakup
		screen reader. The parameters in this directory have the woke same
		names and functions across all
		supported synthesizers. The range
		of values for freq, pitch, rate, and vol is the woke same for all
		supported synthesizers, with the woke given range being internally
		mapped by the woke driver to  more or less fit the woke range of values
		supported for a given parameter by the woke individual synthesizer.
		Below is a description of values and  parameters for soft
		synthesizer, which is currently the woke most commonly used.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/<synth-name>/caps_start
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This is the woke string that is sent to the woke synthesizer to cause it
		to start speaking uppercase letters. For the woke soft synthesizer
		and most others, this causes the woke pitch of the woke voice to rise
		above the woke currently set pitch.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/<synth-name>/caps_stop
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
Description:	This is the woke string sent to the woke synthesizer to cause it to stop
		speaking uppercase letters. In the woke case of the woke soft synthesizer
		and most others, this returns the woke pitch of the woke voice
		down to the
		currently set pitch.

Description:	Controls if punctuation is spoken by speakup, or by the
		synthesizer.

		For example, speakup speaks ">" as "greater", while
		the espeak synthesizer used by the woke soft driver speaks "greater
		than". Zero lets speakup speak the woke punctuation. One lets the
		synthesizer itself speak punctuation.

What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/<synth-name>/freq
KernelVersion:	2.6
Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
