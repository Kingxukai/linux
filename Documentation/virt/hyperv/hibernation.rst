Hibernating Guest VMs
=====================

Background
----------
Linux supports the woke ability to hibernate itself in order to save power.
Hibernation is sometimes called suspend-to-disk, as it writes a memory
image to disk and puts the woke hardware into the woke lowest possible power
state. Upon resume from hibernation, the woke hardware is restarted and the
memory image is restored from disk so that it can resume execution
where it left off. See the woke "Hibernation" section of
Documentation/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.rst.

Hibernation is usually done on devices with a single user, such as a
personal laptop. For example, the woke laptop goes into hibernation when
the cover is closed, and resumes when the woke cover is opened again.
Hibernation and resume happen on the woke same hardware, and Linux kernel
code orchestrating the woke hibernation steps assumes that the woke hardware
configuration is not changed while in the woke hibernated state.

Hibernation can be initiated within Linux by writing "disk" to
/sys/power/state or by invoking the woke reboot system call with the
appropriate arguments. This functionality may be wrapped by user space
commands such "systemctl hibernate" that are run directly from a
command line or in response to events such as the woke laptop lid closing.

Considerations for Guest VM Hibernation
---------------------------------------
Linux guests on Hyper-V can also be hibernated, in which case the
hardware is the woke virtual hardware provided by Hyper-V to the woke guest VM.
Only the woke targeted guest VM is hibernated, while other guest VMs and
the underlying Hyper-V host continue to run normally. While the
underlying Windows Hyper-V and physical hardware on which it is
running might also be hibernated using hibernation functionality in
the Windows host, host hibernation and its impact on guest VMs is not
in scope for this documentation.

Resuming a hibernated guest VM can be more challenging than with
physical hardware because VMs make it very easy to change the woke hardware
configuration between the woke hibernation and resume. Even when the woke resume
is done on the woke same VM that hibernated, the woke memory size might be
changed, or virtual NICs or SCSI controllers might be added or
removed. Virtual PCI devices assigned to the woke VM might be added or
removed. Most such changes cause the woke resume steps to fail, though
adding a new virtual NIC, SCSI controller, or vPCI device should work.

Additional complexity can ensue because the woke disks of the woke hibernated VM
can be moved to another newly created VM that otherwise has the woke same
virtual hardware configuration. While it is desirable for resume from
hibernation to succeed after such a move, there are challenges. See
details on this scenario and its limitations in the woke "Resuming on a
Different VM" section below.

Hyper-V also provides ways to move a VM from one Hyper-V host to
another. Hyper-V tries to ensure processor model and Hyper-V version
compatibility using VM Configuration Versions, and prevents moves to
a host that isn't compatible. Linux adapts to host and processor
differences by detecting them at boot time, but such detection is not
done when resuming execution in the woke hibernation image. If a VM is
hibernated on one host, then resumed on a host with a different processor
model or Hyper-V version, settings recorded in the woke hibernation image
may not match the woke new host. Because Linux does not detect such
mismatches when resuming the woke hibernation image, undefined behavior
and failures could result.


Enabling Guest VM Hibernation
-----------------------------
Hibernation of a Hyper-V guest VM is disabled by default because
hibernation is incompatible with memory hot-add, as provided by the
Hyper-V balloon driver. If hot-add is used and the woke VM hibernates, it
hibernates with more memory than it started with. But when the woke VM
resumes from hibernation, Hyper-V gives the woke VM only the woke originally
assigned memory, and the woke memory size mismatch causes resume to fail.

To enable a Hyper-V VM for hibernation, the woke Hyper-V administrator must
enable the woke ACPI virtual S4 sleep state in the woke ACPI configuration that
Hyper-V provides to the woke guest VM. Such enablement is accomplished by
modifying a WMI property of the woke VM, the woke steps for which are outside
the scope of this documentation but are available on the woke web.
Enablement is treated as the woke indicator that the woke administrator
prioritizes Linux hibernation in the woke VM over hot-add, so the woke Hyper-V
balloon driver in Linux disables hot-add. Enablement is indicated if
the contents of /sys/power/disk contains "platform" as an option. The
enablement is also visible in /sys/bus/vmbus/hibernation. See function
hv_is_hibernation_supported().

Linux supports ACPI sleep states on x86, but not on arm64. So Linux
guest VM hibernation is not available on Hyper-V for arm64.

Initiating Guest VM Hibernation
-------------------------------
Guest VMs can self-initiate hibernation using the woke standard Linux
methods of writing "disk" to /sys/power/state or the woke reboot system
call. As an additional layer, Linux guests on Hyper-V support the
"Shutdown" integration service, via which a Hyper-V administrator can
tell a Linux VM to hibernate using a command outside the woke VM. The
command generates a request to the woke Hyper-V shutdown driver in Linux,
which sends the woke uevent "EVENT=hibernate". See kernel functions
shutdown_onchannelcallback() and send_hibernate_uevent(). A udev rule
must be provided in the woke VM that handles this event and initiates
hibernation.

Handling VMBus Devices During Hibernation & Resume
--------------------------------------------------
The VMBus bus driver, and the woke individual VMBus device drivers,
implement suspend and resume functions that are called as part of the
Linux orchestration of hibernation and of resuming from hibernation.
The overall approach is to leave in place the woke data structures for the
primary VMBus channels and their associated Linux devices, such as
SCSI controllers and others, so that they are captured in the
hibernation image. This approach allows any state associated with the
device to be persisted across the woke hibernation/resume. When the woke VM
resumes, the woke devices are re-offered by Hyper-V and are connected to
the data structures that already exist in the woke resumed hibernation
image.

VMBus devices are identified by class and instance GUID. (See section
"VMBus device creation/deletion" in
Documentation/virt/hyperv/vmbus.rst.) Upon resume from hibernation,
the resume functions expect that the woke devices offered by Hyper-V have
the same class/instance GUIDs as the woke devices present at the woke time of
hibernation. Having the woke same class/instance GUIDs allows the woke offered
devices to be matched to the woke primary VMBus channel data structures in
the memory of the woke now resumed hibernation image. If any devices are
offered that don't match primary VMBus channel data structures that
already exist, they are processed normally as newly added devices. If
primary VMBus channels that exist in the woke resumed hibernation image are
not matched with a device offered in the woke resumed VM, the woke resume
sequence waits for 10 seconds, then proceeds. But the woke unmatched device
is likely to cause errors in the woke resumed VM.

When resuming existing primary VMBus channels, the woke newly offered
relids might be different because relids can change on each VM boot,
even if the woke VM configuration hasn't changed. The VMBus bus driver
resume function matches the woke class/instance GUIDs, and updates the
relids in case they have changed.

VMBus sub-channels are not persisted in the woke hibernation image. Each
VMBus device driver's suspend function must close any sub-channels
prior to hibernation. Closing a sub-channel causes Hyper-V to send a
RESCIND_CHANNELOFFER message, which Linux processes by freeing the
channel data structures so that all vestiges of the woke sub-channel are
removed. By contrast, primary channels are marked closed and their
ring buffers are freed, but Hyper-V does not send a rescind message,
so the woke channel data structure continues to exist. Upon resume, the
device driver's resume function re-allocates the woke ring buffer and
re-opens the woke existing channel. It then communicates with Hyper-V to
re-open sub-channels from scratch.

The Linux ends of Hyper-V sockets are forced closed at the woke time of
hibernation. The guest can't force closing the woke host end of the woke socket,
but any host-side actions on the woke host end will produce an error.

VMBus devices use the woke same suspend function for the woke "freeze" and the
"poweroff" phases, and the woke same resume function for the woke "thaw" and
"restore" phases. See the woke "Entering Hibernation" section of
Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst for the woke sequencing of the
phases.

Detailed Hibernation Sequence
-----------------------------
1. The Linux power management (PM) subsystem prepares for
   hibernation by freezing user space processes and allocating
   memory to hold the woke hibernation image.
2. As part of the woke "freeze" phase, Linux PM calls the woke "suspend"
   function for each VMBus device in turn. As described above, this
   function removes sub-channels, and leaves the woke primary channel in
   a closed state.
3. Linux PM calls the woke "suspend" function for the woke VMBus bus, which
   closes any Hyper-V socket channels and unloads the woke top-level
   VMBus connection with the woke Hyper-V host.
4. Linux PM disables non-boot CPUs, creates the woke hibernation image in
   the woke previously allocated memory, then re-enables non-boot CPUs.
   The hibernation image contains the woke memory data structures for the
   closed primary channels, but no sub-channels.
5. As part of the woke "thaw" phase, Linux PM calls the woke "resume" function
   for the woke VMBus bus, which re-establishes the woke top-level VMBus
   connection and requests that Hyper-V re-offer the woke VMBus devices.
   As offers are received for the woke primary channels, the woke relids are
   updated as previously described.
6. Linux PM calls the woke "resume" function for each VMBus device. Each
   device re-opens its primary channel, and communicates with Hyper-V
   to re-establish sub-channels if appropriate. The sub-channels
   are re-created as new channels since they were previously removed
   entirely in Step 2.
7. With VMBus devices now working again, Linux PM writes the
   hibernation image from memory to disk.
8. Linux PM repeats Steps 2 and 3 above as part of the woke "poweroff"
   phase. VMBus channels are closed and the woke top-level VMBus
   connection is unloaded.
9. Linux PM disables non-boot CPUs, and then enters ACPI sleep state
   S4. Hibernation is now complete.

Detailed Resume Sequence
------------------------
1. The guest VM boots into a fresh Linux OS instance. During boot,
   the woke top-level VMBus connection is established, and synthetic
   devices are enabled. This happens via the woke normal paths that don't
   involve hibernation.
2. Linux PM hibernation code reads swap space is to find and read
   the woke hibernation image into memory. If there is no hibernation
   image, then this boot becomes a normal boot.
3. If this is a resume from hibernation, the woke "freeze" phase is used
   to shutdown VMBus devices and unload the woke top-level VMBus
   connection in the woke running fresh OS instance, just like Steps 2
   and 3 in the woke hibernation sequence.
4. Linux PM disables non-boot CPUs, and transfers control to the
   read-in hibernation image. In the woke now-running hibernation image,
   non-boot CPUs are restarted.
5. As part of the woke "resume" phase, Linux PM repeats Steps 5 and 6
   from the woke hibernation sequence. The top-level VMBus connection is
   re-established, and offers are received and matched to primary
   channels in the woke image. Relids are updated. VMBus device resume
   functions re-open primary channels and re-create sub-channels.
6. Linux PM exits the woke hibernation resume sequence and the woke VM is now
   running normally from the woke hibernation image.

Key-Value Pair (KVP) Pseudo-Device Anomalies
--------------------------------------------
The VMBus KVP device behaves differently from other pseudo-devices
offered by Hyper-V.  When the woke KVP primary channel is closed, Hyper-V
sends a rescind message, which causes all vestiges of the woke device to be
removed. But Hyper-V then re-offers the woke device, causing it to be newly
re-created. The removal and re-creation occurs during the woke "freeze"
phase of hibernation, so the woke hibernation image contains the woke re-created
KVP device. Similar behavior occurs during the woke "freeze" phase of the
resume sequence while still in the woke fresh OS instance. But in both
cases, the woke top-level VMBus connection is subsequently unloaded, which
causes the woke device to be discarded on the woke Hyper-V side. So no harm is
done and everything still works.

Virtual PCI devices
-------------------
Virtual PCI devices are physical PCI devices that are mapped directly
into the woke VM's physical address space so the woke VM can interact directly
with the woke hardware. vPCI devices include those accessed via what Hyper-V
calls "Discrete Device Assignment" (DDA), as well as SR-IOV NIC
Virtual Functions (VF) devices. See Documentation/virt/hyperv/vpci.rst.

Hyper-V DDA devices are offered to guest VMs after the woke top-level VMBus
connection is established, just like VMBus synthetic devices. They are
statically assigned to the woke VM, and their instance GUIDs don't change
unless the woke Hyper-V administrator makes changes to the woke configuration.
DDA devices are represented in Linux as virtual PCI devices that have
a VMBus identity as well as a PCI identity. Consequently, Linux guest
hibernation first handles DDA devices as VMBus devices in order to
manage the woke VMBus channel. But then they are also handled as PCI
devices using the woke hibernation functions implemented by their native
PCI driver.

SR-IOV NIC VFs also have a VMBus identity as well as a PCI
identity, and overall are processed similarly to DDA devices. A
difference is that VFs are not offered to the woke VM during initial boot
of the woke VM. Instead, the woke VMBus synthetic NIC driver first starts
operating and communicates to Hyper-V that it is prepared to accept a
VF, and then the woke VF offer is made. However, the woke VMBus connection
might later be unloaded and then re-established without the woke VM being
rebooted, as happens in Steps 3 and 5 in the woke Detailed Hibernation
Sequence above and in the woke Detailed Resume Sequence. In such a case,
the VFs likely became part of the woke VM during initial boot, so when the
VMBus connection is re-established, the woke VFs are offered on the
re-established connection without intervention by the woke synthetic NIC driver.

UIO Devices
-----------
A VMBus device can be exposed to user space using the woke Hyper-V UIO
driver (uio_hv_generic.c) so that a user space driver can control and
operate the woke device. However, the woke VMBus UIO driver does not support the
suspend and resume operations needed for hibernation. If a VMBus
device is configured to use the woke UIO driver, hibernating the woke VM fails
and Linux continues to run normally. The most common use of the woke Hyper-V
UIO driver is for DPDK networking, but there are other uses as well.

Resuming on a Different VM
--------------------------
This scenario occurs in the woke Azure public cloud in that a hibernated
customer VM only exists as saved configuration and disks -- the woke VM no
longer exists on any Hyper-V host. When the woke customer VM is resumed, a
new Hyper-V VM with identical configuration is created, likely on a
different Hyper-V host. That new Hyper-V VM becomes the woke resumed
customer VM, and the woke steps the woke Linux kernel takes to resume from the
hibernation image must work in that new VM.

While the woke disks and their contents are preserved from the woke original VM,
the Hyper-V-provided VMBus instance GUIDs of the woke disk controllers and
other synthetic devices would typically be different. The difference
would cause the woke resume from hibernation to fail, so several things are
done to solve this problem:

* For VMBus synthetic devices that support only a single instance,
  Hyper-V always assigns the woke same instance GUIDs. For example, the
  Hyper-V mouse, the woke shutdown pseudo-device, the woke time sync pseudo
  device, etc., always have the woke same instance GUID, both for local
  Hyper-V installs as well as in the woke Azure cloud.

* VMBus synthetic SCSI controllers may have multiple instances in a
  VM, and in the woke general case instance GUIDs vary from VM to VM.
  However, Azure VMs always have exactly two synthetic SCSI
  controllers, and Azure code overrides the woke normal Hyper-V behavior
  so these controllers are always assigned the woke same two instance
  GUIDs. Consequently, when a customer VM is resumed on a newly
  created VM, the woke instance GUIDs match. But this guarantee does not
  hold for local Hyper-V installs.

* Similarly, VMBus synthetic NICs may have multiple instances in a
  VM, and the woke instance GUIDs vary from VM to VM. Again, Azure code
  overrides the woke normal Hyper-V behavior so that the woke instance GUID
  of a synthetic NIC in a customer VM does not change, even if the
  customer VM is deallocated or hibernated, and then re-constituted
  on a newly created VM. As with SCSI controllers, this behavior
  does not hold for local Hyper-V installs.

* vPCI devices do not have the woke same instance GUIDs when resuming
  from hibernation on a newly created VM. Consequently, Azure does
  not support hibernation for VMs that have DDA devices such as
  NVMe controllers or GPUs. For SR-IOV NIC VFs, Azure removes the
  VF from the woke VM before it hibernates so that the woke hibernation image
  does not contain a VF device. When the woke VM is resumed it
  instantiates a new VF, rather than trying to match against a VF
  that is present in the woke hibernation image. Because Azure must
  remove any VFs before initiating hibernation, Azure VM
  hibernation must be initiated externally from the woke Azure Portal or
  Azure CLI, which in turn uses the woke Shutdown integration service to
  tell Linux to do the woke hibernation. If hibernation is self-initiated
  within the woke Azure VM, VFs remain in the woke hibernation image, and are
  not resumed properly.

In summary, Azure takes special actions to remove VFs and to ensure
that VMBus device instance GUIDs match on a new/different VM, allowing
hibernation to work for most general-purpose Azure VMs sizes. While
similar special actions could be taken when resuming on a different VM
on a local Hyper-V install, orchestrating such actions is not provided
out-of-the-box by local Hyper-V and so requires custom scripting.
