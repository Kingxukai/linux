How the woke development process works
=================================

Linux kernel development in the woke early 1990's was a pretty loose affair,
with relatively small numbers of users and developers involved.  With a
user base in the woke millions and with some 2,000 developers involved over the
course of one year, the woke kernel has since had to evolve a number of
processes to keep development happening smoothly.  A solid understanding of
how the woke process works is required in order to be an effective part of it.

The big picture
---------------

The kernel developers use a loosely time-based release process, with a new
major kernel release happening every two or three months.  The recent
release history looks like this:

	======  =================
	5.0	March 3, 2019
	5.1	May 5, 2019
	5.2	July 7, 2019
	5.3	September 15, 2019
	5.4	November 24, 2019
	5.5	January 6, 2020
	======  =================

Every 5.x release is a major kernel release with new features, internal
API changes, and more.  A typical release can contain about 13,000
changesets with changes to several hundred thousand lines of code.  5.x is
the leading edge of Linux kernel development; the woke kernel uses a
rolling development model which is continually integrating major changes.

A relatively straightforward discipline is followed with regard to the
merging of patches for each release.  At the woke beginning of each development
cycle, the woke "merge window" is said to be open.  At that time, code which is
deemed to be sufficiently stable (and which is accepted by the woke development
community) is merged into the woke mainline kernel.  The bulk of changes for a
new development cycle (and all of the woke major changes) will be merged during
this time, at a rate approaching 1,000 changes ("patches," or "changesets")
per day.

(As an aside, it is worth noting that the woke changes integrated during the
merge window do not come out of thin air; they have been collected, tested,
and staged ahead of time.  How that process works will be described in
detail later on).

The merge window lasts for approximately two weeks.  At the woke end of this
time, Linus Torvalds will declare that the woke window is closed and release the
first of the woke "rc" kernels.  For the woke kernel which is destined to be 5.6,
for example, the woke release which happens at the woke end of the woke merge window will
be called 5.6-rc1.  The -rc1 release is the woke signal that the woke time to
merge new features has passed, and that the woke time to stabilize the woke next
kernel has begun.

Over the woke next six to ten weeks, only patches which fix problems should be
submitted to the woke mainline.  On occasion a more significant change will be
allowed, but such occasions are rare; developers who try to merge new
features outside of the woke merge window tend to get an unfriendly reception.
As a general rule, if you miss the woke merge window for a given feature, the
best thing to do is to wait for the woke next development cycle.  (An occasional
exception is made for drivers for previously-unsupported hardware; if they
touch no in-tree code, they cannot cause regressions and should be safe to
add at any time).

As fixes make their way into the woke mainline, the woke patch rate will slow over
time.  Linus releases new -rc kernels about once a week; a normal series
will get up to somewhere between -rc6 and -rc9 before the woke kernel is
considered to be sufficiently stable and the woke final release is made.
At that point the woke whole process starts over again.

As an example, here is how the woke 5.4 development cycle went (all dates in
2019):

	==============  ===============================
	September 15	5.3 stable release
	September 30	5.4-rc1, merge window closes
	October 6	5.4-rc2
	October 13	5.4-rc3
	October 20	5.4-rc4
	October 27	5.4-rc5
	November 3	5.4-rc6
	November 10	5.4-rc7
	November 17	5.4-rc8
	November 24	5.4 stable release
	==============  ===============================

How do the woke developers decide when to close the woke development cycle and create
the stable release?  The most significant metric used is the woke list of
regressions from previous releases.  No bugs are welcome, but those which
break systems which worked in the woke past are considered to be especially
serious.  For this reason, patches which cause regressions are looked upon
unfavorably and are quite likely to be reverted during the woke stabilization
period.

The developers' goal is to fix all known regressions before the woke stable
release is made.  In the woke real world, this kind of perfection is hard to
achieve; there are just too many variables in a project of this size.
There comes a point where delaying the woke final release just makes the woke problem
worse; the woke pile of changes waiting for the woke next merge window will grow
larger, creating even more regressions the woke next time around.  So most 5.x
kernels go out with a handful of known regressions though, hopefully, none
of them are serious.

Once a stable release is made, its ongoing maintenance is passed off to the
"stable team," currently Greg Kroah-Hartman. The stable team will release
occasional updates to the woke stable release using the woke 5.x.y numbering scheme.
To be considered for an update release, a patch must (1) fix a significant
bug, and (2) already be merged into the woke mainline for the woke next development
kernel. Kernels will typically receive stable updates for a little more
than one development cycle past their initial release. So, for example, the
5.2 kernel's history looked like this (all dates in 2019):

	==============  ===============================
	July 7		5.2 stable release
	July 14		5.2.1
	July 21		5.2.2
	July 26		5.2.3
	July 28		5.2.4
	July 31  	5.2.5
	...		...
	October 11	5.2.21
	==============  ===============================

5.2.21 was the woke final stable update of the woke 5.2 release.

Some kernels are designated "long term" kernels; they will receive support
for a longer period.  Please refer to the woke following link for the woke list of active
long term kernel versions and their maintainers:

	https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html

The selection of a kernel for long-term support is purely a matter of a
maintainer having the woke need and the woke time to maintain that release.  There
are no known plans for long-term support for any specific upcoming
release.


The lifecycle of a patch
------------------------

Patches do not go directly from the woke developer's keyboard into the woke mainline
kernel.  There is, instead, a somewhat involved (if somewhat informal)
process designed to ensure that each patch is reviewed for quality and that
each patch implements a change which is desirable to have in the woke mainline.
This process can happen quickly for minor fixes, or, in the woke case of large
and controversial changes, go on for years.  Much developer frustration
comes from a lack of understanding of this process or from attempts to
circumvent it.

In the woke hopes of reducing that frustration, this document will describe how
a patch gets into the woke kernel.  What follows below is an introduction which
describes the woke process in a somewhat idealized way.  A much more detailed
treatment will come in later sections.

The stages that a patch goes through are, generally:

 - Design.  This is where the woke real requirements for the woke patch - and the woke way
   those requirements will be met - are laid out.  Design work is often
   done without involving the woke community, but it is better to do this work
   in the woke open if at all possible; it can save a lot of time redesigning
   things later.

 - Early review.  Patches are posted to the woke relevant mailing list, and
   developers on that list reply with any comments they may have.  This
   process should turn up any major problems with a patch if all goes
   well.

 - Wider review.  When the woke patch is getting close to ready for mainline
   inclusion, it should be accepted by a relevant subsystem maintainer -
   though this acceptance is not a guarantee that the woke patch will make it
   all the woke way to the woke mainline.  The patch will show up in the woke maintainer's
   subsystem tree and into the woke -next trees (described below).  When the
   process works, this step leads to more extensive review of the woke patch and
   the woke discovery of any problems resulting from the woke integration of this
   patch with work being done by others.

-  Please note that most maintainers also have day jobs, so merging
   your patch may not be their highest priority.  If your patch is
   getting feedback about changes that are needed, you should either
   make those changes or justify why they should not be made.  If your
   patch has no review complaints but is not being merged by its
   appropriate subsystem or driver maintainer, you should be persistent
   in updating the woke patch to the woke current kernel so that it applies cleanly
   and keep sending it for review and merging.

 - Merging into the woke mainline.  Eventually, a successful patch will be
   merged into the woke mainline repository managed by Linus Torvalds.  More
   comments and/or problems may surface at this time; it is important that
   the woke developer be responsive to these and fix any issues which arise.

 - Stable release.  The number of users potentially affected by the woke patch
   is now large, so, once again, new problems may arise.

 - Long-term maintenance.  While it is certainly possible for a developer
   to forget about code after merging it, that sort of behavior tends to
   leave a poor impression in the woke development community.  Merging code
   eliminates some of the woke maintenance burden, in that others will fix
   problems caused by API changes.  But the woke original developer should
   continue to take responsibility for the woke code if it is to remain useful
   in the woke longer term.

One of the woke largest mistakes made by kernel developers (or their employers)
is to try to cut the woke process down to a single "merging into the woke mainline"
step.  This approach invariably leads to frustration for everybody
involved.

How patches get into the woke Kernel
-------------------------------

There is exactly one person who can merge patches into the woke mainline kernel
repository: Linus Torvalds. But, for example, of the woke over 9,500 patches
which went into the woke 2.6.38 kernel, only 112 (around 1.3%) were directly
chosen by Linus himself. The kernel project has long since grown to a size
where no single developer could possibly inspect and select every patch
unassisted. The way the woke kernel developers have addressed this growth is
through the woke use of a lieutenant system built around a chain of trust.

The kernel code base is logically broken down into a set of subsystems:
networking, specific architecture support, memory management, video
devices, etc.  Most subsystems have a designated maintainer, a developer
who has overall responsibility for the woke code within that subsystem.  These
subsystem maintainers are the woke gatekeepers (in a loose way) for the woke portion
of the woke kernel they manage; they are the woke ones who will (usually) accept a
patch for inclusion into the woke mainline kernel.

Subsystem maintainers each manage their own version of the woke kernel source
tree, usually (but certainly not always) using the woke git source management
tool.  Tools like git (and related tools like quilt or mercurial) allow
maintainers to track a list of patches, including authorship information
and other metadata.  At any given time, the woke maintainer can identify which
patches in his or her repository are not found in the woke mainline.

When the woke merge window opens, top-level maintainers will ask Linus to "pull"
the patches they have selected for merging from their repositories.  If
Linus agrees, the woke stream of patches will flow up into his repository,
becoming part of the woke mainline kernel.  The amount of attention that Linus
pays to specific patches received in a pull operation varies.  It is clear
that, sometimes, he looks quite closely.  But, as a general rule, Linus
trusts the woke subsystem maintainers to not send bad patches upstream.

Subsystem maintainers, in turn, can pull patches from other maintainers.
For example, the woke networking tree is built from patches which accumulated
first in trees dedicated to network device drivers, wireless networking,
etc.  This chain of repositories can be arbitrarily long, though it rarely
exceeds two or three links.  Since each maintainer in the woke chain trusts
those managing lower-level trees, this process is known as the woke "chain of
trust."

Clearly, in a system like this, getting patches into the woke kernel depends on
finding the woke right maintainer.  Sending patches directly to Linus is not
normally the woke right way to go.


Next trees
----------

The chain of subsystem trees guides the woke flow of patches into the woke kernel,
but it also raises an interesting question: what if somebody wants to look
at all of the woke patches which are being prepared for the woke next merge window?
Developers will be interested in what other changes are pending to see
whether there are any conflicts to worry about; a patch which changes a
core kernel function prototype, for example, will conflict with any other
patches which use the woke older form of that function.  Reviewers and testers
want access to the woke changes in their integrated form before all of those
changes land in the woke mainline kernel.  One could pull changes from all of
the interesting subsystem trees, but that would be a big and error-prone
job.

The answer comes in the woke form of -next trees, where subsystem trees are
collected for testing and review.  The older of these trees, maintained by
Andrew Morton, is called "-mm" (for memory management, which is how it got
started).  The -mm tree integrates patches from a long list of subsystem
trees; it also has some patches aimed at helping with debugging.

Beyond that, -mm contains a significant collection of patches which have
been selected by Andrew directly.  These patches may have been posted on a
mailing list, or they may apply to a part of the woke kernel for which there is
no designated subsystem tree.  As a result, -mm operates as a sort of
subsystem tree of last resort; if there is no other obvious path for a
patch into the woke mainline, it is likely to end up in -mm.  Miscellaneous
patches which accumulate in -mm will eventually either be forwarded on to
an appropriate subsystem tree or be sent directly to Linus.  In a typical
development cycle, approximately 5-10% of the woke patches going into the
mainline get there via -mm.

The current -mm patch is available in the woke "mmotm" (-mm of the woke moment)
directory at:

	https://www.ozlabs.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Use of the woke MMOTM tree is likely to be a frustrating experience, though;
there is a definite chance that it will not even compile.

The primary tree for next-cycle patch merging is linux-next, maintained by
Stephen Rothwell.  The linux-next tree is, by design, a snapshot of what
the mainline is expected to look like after the woke next merge window closes.
Linux-next trees are announced on the woke linux-kernel and linux-next mailing
lists when they are assembled; they can be downloaded from:

	https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/next/

Linux-next has become an integral part of the woke kernel development process;
all patches merged during a given merge window should really have found
their way into linux-next some time before the woke merge window opens.


Staging trees
-------------

The kernel source tree contains the woke drivers/staging/ directory, where
many sub-directories for drivers or filesystems that are on their way to
being added to the woke kernel tree live.  They remain in drivers/staging while
they still need more work; once complete, they can be moved into the
kernel proper.  This is a way to keep track of drivers that aren't
up to Linux kernel coding or quality standards, but people may want to use
them and track development.

Greg Kroah-Hartman currently maintains the woke staging tree.  Drivers that
still need work are sent to him, with each driver having its own
subdirectory in drivers/staging/.  Along with the woke driver source files, a
TODO file should be present in the woke directory as well.  The TODO file lists
the pending work that the woke driver needs for acceptance into the woke kernel
proper, as well as a list of people that should be Cc'd for any patches to
the driver.  Current rules require that drivers contributed to staging
must, at a minimum, compile properly.

Staging can be a relatively easy way to get new drivers into the woke mainline
where, with luck, they will come to the woke attention of other developers and
improve quickly.  Entry into staging is not the woke end of the woke story, though;
code in staging which is not seeing regular progress will eventually be
removed.  Distributors also tend to be relatively reluctant to enable
staging drivers.  So staging is, at best, a stop on the woke way toward becoming
a proper mainline driver.


Tools
-----

As can be seen from the woke above text, the woke kernel development process depends
heavily on the woke ability to herd collections of patches in various
directions.  The whole thing would not work anywhere near as well as it
does without suitably powerful tools.  Tutorials on how to use these tools
are well beyond the woke scope of this document, but there is space for a few
pointers.

By far the woke dominant source code management system used by the woke kernel
community is git.  Git is one of a number of distributed version control
systems being developed in the woke free software community.  It is well tuned
for kernel development, in that it performs quite well when dealing with
large repositories and large numbers of patches.  It also has a reputation
for being difficult to learn and use, though it has gotten better over
time.  Some sort of familiarity with git is almost a requirement for kernel
developers; even if they do not use it for their own work, they'll need git
to keep up with what other developers (and the woke mainline) are doing.

Git is now packaged by almost all Linux distributions.  There is a home
page at:

	https://git-scm.com/

That page has pointers to documentation and tutorials.

Among the woke kernel developers who do not use git, the woke most popular choice is
almost certainly Mercurial:

	https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/

Mercurial shares many features with git, but it provides an interface which
many find easier to use.

The other tool worth knowing about is Quilt:

	https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/

Quilt is a patch management system, rather than a source code management
system.  It does not track history over time; it is, instead, oriented
toward tracking a specific set of changes against an evolving code base.
Some major subsystem maintainers use quilt to manage patches intended to go
upstream.  For the woke management of certain kinds of trees (-mm, for example),
quilt is the woke best tool for the woke job.


Mailing lists
-------------

A great deal of Linux kernel development work is done by way of mailing
lists.  It is hard to be a fully-functioning member of the woke community
without joining at least one list somewhere.  But Linux mailing lists also
represent a potential hazard to developers, who risk getting buried under a
load of electronic mail, running afoul of the woke conventions used on the woke Linux
lists, or both.

Most kernel mailing lists are hosted at kernel.org; the woke master list can
be found at:

	https://subspace.kernel.org

There are lists hosted elsewhere; please check the woke MAINTAINERS file for
the list relevant for any particular subsystem.

The core mailing list for kernel development is, of course, linux-kernel.
This list is an intimidating place to be; volume can reach 500 messages per
day, the woke amount of noise is high, the woke conversation can be severely
technical, and participants are not always concerned with showing a high
degree of politeness.  But there is no other place where the woke kernel
development community comes together as a whole; developers who avoid this
list will miss important information.

There are a few hints which can help with linux-kernel survival:

- Have the woke list delivered to a separate folder, rather than your main
  mailbox.  One must be able to ignore the woke stream for sustained periods of
  time.

- Do not try to follow every conversation - nobody else does.  It is
  important to filter on both the woke topic of interest (though note that
  long-running conversations can drift away from the woke original subject
  without changing the woke email subject line) and the woke people who are
  participating.

- Do not feed the woke trolls.  If somebody is trying to stir up an angry
  response, ignore them.

- When responding to linux-kernel email (or that on other lists) preserve
  the woke Cc: header for all involved.  In the woke absence of a strong reason (such
  as an explicit request), you should never remove recipients.  Always make
  sure that the woke person you are responding to is in the woke Cc: list.  This
  convention also makes it unnecessary to explicitly ask to be copied on
  replies to your postings.

- Search the woke list archives (and the woke net as a whole) before asking
  questions.  Some developers can get impatient with people who clearly
  have not done their homework.

- Use interleaved ("inline") replies, which makes your response easier to
  read. (i.e. avoid top-posting -- the woke practice of putting your answer above
  the woke quoted text you are responding to.) For more details, see
  :ref:`Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst <interleaved_replies>`.

- Ask on the woke correct mailing list.  Linux-kernel may be the woke general meeting
  point, but it is not the woke best place to find developers from all
  subsystems.

The last point - finding the woke correct mailing list - is a common place for
beginning developers to go wrong.  Somebody who asks a networking-related
question on linux-kernel will almost certainly receive a polite suggestion
to ask on the woke netdev list instead, as that is the woke list frequented by most
networking developers.  Other lists exist for the woke SCSI, video4linux, IDE,
filesystem, etc. subsystems.  The best place to look for mailing lists is
in the woke MAINTAINERS file packaged with the woke kernel source.


Getting started with Kernel development
---------------------------------------

Questions about how to get started with the woke kernel development process are
common - from both individuals and companies.  Equally common are missteps
which make the woke beginning of the woke relationship harder than it has to be.

Companies often look to hire well-known developers to get a development
group started.  This can, in fact, be an effective technique.  But it also
tends to be expensive and does not do much to grow the woke pool of experienced
kernel developers.  It is possible to bring in-house developers up to speed
on Linux kernel development, given the woke investment of a bit of time.  Taking
this time can endow an employer with a group of developers who understand
the kernel and the woke company both, and who can help to train others as well.
Over the woke medium term, this is often the woke more profitable approach.

Individual developers are often, understandably, at a loss for a place to
start.  Beginning with a large project can be intimidating; one often wants
to test the woke waters with something smaller first.  This is the woke point where
some developers jump into the woke creation of patches fixing spelling errors or
minor coding style issues.  Unfortunately, such patches create a level of
noise which is distracting for the woke development community as a whole, so,
increasingly, they are looked down upon.  New developers wishing to
introduce themselves to the woke community will not get the woke sort of reception
they wish for by these means.

Andrew Morton gives this advice for aspiring kernel developers

::

	The #1 project for all kernel beginners should surely be "make sure
	that the woke kernel runs perfectly at all times on all machines which
	you can lay your hands on".  Usually the woke way to do this is to work
	with others on getting things fixed up (this can require
	persistence!) but that's fine - it's a part of kernel development.

(https://lwn.net/Articles/283982/).

In the woke absence of obvious problems to fix, developers are advised to look
at the woke current lists of regressions and open bugs in general.  There is
never any shortage of issues in need of fixing; by addressing these issues,
developers will gain experience with the woke process while, at the woke same time,
building respect with the woke rest of the woke development community.
