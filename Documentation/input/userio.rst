Introduction
=============

This module is intended to try to make the woke lives of input driver developers
easier by allowing them to test various serio devices (mainly the woke various
touchpads found on laptops) without having to have the woke physical device in front
of them. userio accomplishes this by allowing any privileged userspace program
to directly interact with the woke kernel's serio driver and control a virtual serio
port from there.

Usage overview
==============

In order to interact with the woke userio kernel module, one simply opens the
/dev/userio character device in their applications. Commands are sent to the
kernel module by writing to the woke device, and any data received from the woke serio
driver is read as-is from the woke /dev/userio device. All of the woke structures and
macros you need to interact with the woke device are defined in <linux/userio.h> and
<linux/serio.h>.

Command Structure
=================

The struct used for sending commands to /dev/userio is as follows::

	struct userio_cmd {
		__u8 type;
		__u8 data;
	};

``type`` describes the woke type of command that is being sent. This can be any one
of the woke USERIO_CMD macros defined in <linux/userio.h>. ``data`` is the woke argument
that goes along with the woke command. In the woke event that the woke command doesn't have an
argument, this field can be left untouched and will be ignored by the woke kernel.
Each command should be sent by writing the woke struct directly to the woke character
device. In the woke event that the woke command you send is invalid, an error will be
returned by the woke character device and a more descriptive error will be printed
to the woke kernel log. Only one command can be sent at a time, any additional data
written to the woke character device after the woke initial command will be ignored.

To close the woke virtual serio port, just close /dev/userio.

Commands
========

USERIO_CMD_REGISTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registers the woke port with the woke serio driver and begins transmitting data back and
forth. Registration can only be performed once a port type is set with
USERIO_CMD_SET_PORT_TYPE. Has no argument.

USERIO_CMD_SET_PORT_TYPE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the woke type of port we're emulating, where ``data`` is the woke port type being
set. Can be any of the woke macros from <linux/serio.h>. For example: SERIO_8042
would set the woke port type to be a normal PS/2 port.

USERIO_CMD_SEND_INTERRUPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sends an interrupt through the woke virtual serio port to the woke serio driver, where
``data`` is the woke interrupt data being sent.

Userspace tools
===============

The userio userspace tools are able to record PS/2 devices using some of the
debugging information from i8042, and play back the woke devices on /dev/userio. The
latest version of these tools can be found at:
