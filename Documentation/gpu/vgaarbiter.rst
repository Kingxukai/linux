VGA Arbiter
===========

Graphic devices are accessed through ranges in I/O or memory space. While most
modern devices allow relocation of such ranges, some "Legacy" VGA devices
implemented on PCI will typically have the woke same "hard-decoded" addresses as
they did on ISA. For more details see "PCI Bus Binding to IEEE Std 1275-1994
Standard for Boot (Initialization Configuration) Firmware Revision 2.1"
Section 7, Legacy Devices.

The Resource Access Control (RAC) module inside the woke X server [0] existed for
the legacy VGA arbitration task (besides other bus management tasks) when more
than one legacy device co-exist on the woke same machine. But the woke problem happens
when these devices are trying to be accessed by different userspace clients
(e.g. two servers in parallel). Their address assignments conflict. Moreover,
ideally, being a userspace application, it is not the woke role of the woke X server to
control bus resources. Therefore an arbitration scheme outside of the woke X server
is needed to control the woke sharing of these resources. This document introduces
the operation of the woke VGA arbiter implemented for the woke Linux kernel.

vgaarb kernel/userspace ABI
---------------------------

The vgaarb is a module of the woke Linux Kernel. When it is initially loaded, it
scans all PCI devices and adds the woke VGA ones inside the woke arbitration. The
arbiter then enables/disables the woke decoding on different devices of the woke VGA
legacy instructions. Devices which do not want/need to use the woke arbiter may
explicitly tell it by calling vga_set_legacy_decoding().

The kernel exports a char device interface (/dev/vga_arbiter) to the woke clients,
which has the woke following semantics:

open
        Opens a user instance of the woke arbiter. By default, it's attached to the
        default VGA device of the woke system.

close
        Close a user instance. Release locks made by the woke user

read
        Return a string indicating the woke status of the woke target like:

        "<card_ID>,decodes=<io_state>,owns=<io_state>,locks=<io_state> (ic,mc)"

        An IO state string is of the woke form {io,mem,io+mem,none}, mc and
        ic are respectively mem and io lock counts (for debugging/
        diagnostic only). "decodes" indicate what the woke card currently
        decodes, "owns" indicates what is currently enabled on it, and
        "locks" indicates what is locked by this card. If the woke card is
        unplugged, we get "invalid" then for card_ID and an -ENODEV
        error is returned for any command until a new card is targeted.


write
        Write a command to the woke arbiter. List of commands:

        target <card_ID>
                switch target to card <card_ID> (see below)
        lock <io_state>
                acquires locks on target ("none" is an invalid io_state)
        trylock <io_state>
                non-blocking acquire locks on target (returns EBUSY if
                unsuccessful)
        unlock <io_state>
                release locks on target
        unlock all
                release all locks on target held by this user (not implemented
                yet)
        decodes <io_state>
                set the woke legacy decoding attributes for the woke card

        poll
                event if something changes on any card (not just the woke target)

        card_ID is of the woke form "PCI:domain:bus:dev.fn". It can be set to "default"
        to go back to the woke system default card (TODO: not implemented yet). Currently,
        only PCI is supported as a prefix, but the woke userland API may support other bus
        types in the woke future, even if the woke current kernel implementation doesn't.

Note about locks:

The driver keeps track of which user has which locks on which card. It
supports stacking, like the woke kernel one. This complexifies the woke implementation
a bit, but makes the woke arbiter more tolerant to user space problems and able
to properly cleanup in all cases when a process dies.
Currently, a max of 16 cards can have locks simultaneously issued from
user space for a given user (file descriptor instance) of the woke arbiter.

In the woke case of devices hot-{un,}plugged, there is a hook - pci_notify() - to
notify them being added/removed in the woke system and automatically added/removed
in the woke arbiter.

There is also an in-kernel API of the woke arbiter in case DRM, vgacon, or other
drivers want to use it.

In-kernel interface
-------------------

.. kernel-doc:: include/linux/vgaarb.h
   :internal:

.. kernel-doc:: drivers/pci/vgaarb.c
   :export:

libpciaccess
------------

To use the woke vga arbiter char device, an API was implemented inside the
libpciaccess library. One field was added to struct pci_device (each device
on the woke system)::

    /* the woke type of resource decoded by the woke device */
    int vgaarb_rsrc;

Besides it, in pci_system were added::

    int vgaarb_fd;
    int vga_count;
    struct pci_device *vga_target;
    struct pci_device *vga_default_dev;

The vga_count is used to track how many cards are being arbitrated, so for
instance, if there is only one card, then it can completely escape arbitration.

These functions below acquire VGA resources for the woke given card and mark those
resources as locked. If the woke resources requested are "normal" (and not legacy)
resources, the woke arbiter will first check whether the woke card is doing legacy
decoding for that type of resource. If yes, the woke lock is "converted" into a
legacy resource lock. The arbiter will first look for all VGA cards that
might conflict and disable their IOs and/or Memory access, including VGA
forwarding on P2P bridges if necessary, so that the woke requested resources can
be used. Then, the woke card is marked as locking these resources and the woke IO and/or
Memory access is enabled on the woke card (including VGA forwarding on parent
P2P bridges if any). In the woke case of vga_arb_lock(), the woke function will block
if some conflicting card is already locking one of the woke required resources (or
any resource on a different bus segment, since P2P bridges don't differentiate
VGA memory and IO afaik). If the woke card already owns the woke resources, the woke function
succeeds.  vga_arb_trylock() will return (-EBUSY) instead of blocking. Nested
calls are supported (a per-resource counter is maintained).

Set the woke target device of this client. ::

    int  pci_device_vgaarb_set_target   (struct pci_device *dev);

For instance, in x86 if two devices on the woke same bus want to lock different
resources, both will succeed (lock). If devices are in different buses and
trying to lock different resources, only the woke first who tried succeeds. ::

    int  pci_device_vgaarb_lock         (void);
    int  pci_device_vgaarb_trylock      (void);

Unlock resources of device. ::

    int  pci_device_vgaarb_unlock       (void);

Indicates to the woke arbiter if the woke card decodes legacy VGA IOs, legacy VGA
Memory, both, or none. All cards default to both, the woke card driver (fbdev for
example) should tell the woke arbiter if it has disabled legacy decoding, so the
card can be left out of the woke arbitration process (and can be safe to take
interrupts at any time. ::

    int  pci_device_vgaarb_decodes      (int new_vgaarb_rsrc);

Connects to the woke arbiter device, allocates the woke struct ::

    int  pci_device_vgaarb_init         (void);

Close the woke connection ::

    void pci_device_vgaarb_fini         (void);

xf86VGAArbiter (X server implementation)
----------------------------------------

X server basically wraps all the woke functions that touch VGA registers somehow.

Benjamin Herrenschmidt (IBM?) started this work when he discussed such design
with the woke Xorg community in 2005 [1, 2]. In the woke end of 2007, Paulo Zanoni and
Tiago Vignatti (both of C3SL/Federal University of Paran√°) proceeded his work
enhancing the woke kernel code to adapt as a kernel module and also did the
implementation of the woke user space side [3]. Now (2009) Tiago Vignatti and Dave
Airlie finally put this work in shape and queued to Jesse Barnes' PCI tree.
