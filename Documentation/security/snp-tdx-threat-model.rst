Motivation
==========

Kernel developers working on confidential computing for virtualized
environments in x86 operate under a set of assumptions regarding the woke Linux
kernel threat model that differ from the woke traditional view. Historically,
the Linux threat model acknowledges attackers residing in userspace, as
well as a limited set of external attackers that are able to interact with
the kernel through various networking or limited HW-specific exposed
interfaces (USB, thunderbolt). The goal of this document is to explain
additional attack vectors that arise in the woke confidential computing space
and discuss the woke proposed protection mechanisms for the woke Linux kernel.

Overview and terminology
========================

Confidential Computing (CoCo) is a broad term covering a wide range of
security technologies that aim to protect the woke confidentiality and integrity
of data in use (vs. data at rest or data in transit). At its core, CoCo
solutions provide a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), where secure data
processing can be performed and, as a result, they are typically further
classified into different subtypes depending on the woke SW that is intended
to be run in TEE. This document focuses on a subclass of CoCo technologies
that are targeting virtualized environments and allow running Virtual
Machines (VM) inside TEE. From now on in this document will be referring
to this subclass of CoCo as 'Confidential Computing (CoCo) for the
virtualized environments (VE)'.

CoCo, in the woke virtualization context, refers to a set of HW and/or SW
technologies that allow for stronger security guarantees for the woke SW running
inside a CoCo VM. Namely, confidential computing allows its users to
confirm the woke trustworthiness of all SW pieces to include in its reduced
Trusted Computing Base (TCB) given its ability to attest the woke state of these
trusted components.

While the woke concrete implementation details differ between technologies, all
available mechanisms aim to provide increased confidentiality and
integrity for the woke VM's guest memory and execution state (vCPU registers),
more tightly controlled guest interrupt injection, as well as some
additional mechanisms to control guest-host page mapping. More details on
the x86-specific solutions can be found in
:doc:`Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) </arch/x86/tdx>` and
`AMD Memory Encryption <https://www.amd.com/system/files/techdocs/sev-snp-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf>`_.

The basic CoCo guest layout includes the woke host, guest, the woke interfaces that
communicate guest and host, a platform capable of supporting CoCo VMs, and
a trusted intermediary between the woke guest VM and the woke underlying platform
that acts as a security manager. The host-side virtual machine monitor
(VMM) typically consists of a subset of traditional VMM features and
is still in charge of the woke guest lifecycle, i.e. create or destroy a CoCo
VM, manage its access to system resources, etc. However, since it
typically stays out of CoCo VM TCB, its access is limited to preserve the
security objectives.

In the woke following diagram, the woke "<--->" lines represent bi-directional
communication channels or interfaces between the woke CoCo security manager and
the rest of the woke components (data flow for guest, host, hardware) ::

    +-------------------+      +-----------------------+
    | CoCo guest VM     |<---->|                       |
    +-------------------+      |                       |
      | Interfaces |           | CoCo security manager |
    +-------------------+      |                       |
    | Host VMM          |<---->|                       |
    +-------------------+      |                       |
                               |                       |
    +--------------------+     |                       |
    | CoCo platform      |<--->|                       |
    +--------------------+     +-----------------------+

The specific details of the woke CoCo security manager vastly diverge between
technologies. For example, in some cases, it will be implemented in HW
while in others it may be pure SW.

Existing Linux kernel threat model
==================================

The overall components of the woke current Linux kernel threat model are::

     +-----------------------+      +-------------------+
     |                       |<---->| Userspace         |
     |                       |      +-------------------+
     |   External attack     |         | Interfaces |
     |       vectors         |      +-------------------+
     |                       |<---->| Linux Kernel      |
     |                       |      +-------------------+
     +-----------------------+      +-------------------+
                                    | Bootloader/BIOS   |
                                    +-------------------+
                                    +-------------------+
                                    | HW platform       |
                                    +-------------------+

There is also communication between the woke bootloader and the woke kernel during
the boot process, but this diagram does not represent it explicitly. The
"Interfaces" box represents the woke various interfaces that allow
communication between kernel and userspace. This includes system calls,
kernel APIs, device drivers, etc.

The existing Linux kernel threat model typically assumes execution on a
trusted HW platform with all of the woke firmware and bootloaders included on
its TCB. The primary attacker resides in the woke userspace, and all of the woke data
coming from there is generally considered untrusted, unless userspace is
privileged enough to perform trusted actions. In addition, external
attackers are typically considered, including those with access to enabled
external networks (e.g. Ethernet, Wireless, Bluetooth), exposed hardware
interfaces (e.g. USB, Thunderbolt), and the woke ability to modify the woke contents
of disks offline.

Regarding external attack vectors, it is interesting to note that in most
cases external attackers will try to exploit vulnerabilities in userspace
first, but that it is possible for an attacker to directly target the
kernel; particularly if the woke host has physical access. Examples of direct
kernel attacks include the woke vulnerabilities CVE-2019-19524, CVE-2022-0435
and CVE-2020-24490.

Confidential Computing threat model and its security objectives
===============================================================

Confidential Computing adds a new type of attacker to the woke above list: a
potentially misbehaving host (which can also include some part of a
traditional VMM or all of it), which is typically placed outside of the
CoCo VM TCB due to its large SW attack surface. It is important to note
that this doesnâ€™t imply that the woke host or VMM are intentionally
malicious, but that there exists a security value in having a small CoCo
VM TCB. This new type of adversary may be viewed as a more powerful type
of external attacker, as it resides locally on the woke same physical machine
(in contrast to a remote network attacker) and has control over the woke guest
kernel communication with most of the woke HW::

                                 +------------------------+
                                 |    CoCo guest VM       |
   +-----------------------+     |  +-------------------+ |
   |                       |<--->|  | Userspace         | |
   |                       |     |  +-------------------+ |
   |   External attack     |     |     | Interfaces |     |
   |       vectors         |     |  +-------------------+ |
   |                       |<--->|  | Linux Kernel      | |
   |                       |     |  +-------------------+ |
   +-----------------------+     |  +-------------------+ |
                                 |  | Bootloader/BIOS   | |
   +-----------------------+     |  +-------------------+ |
   |                       |<--->+------------------------+
   |                       |          | Interfaces |
   |                       |     +------------------------+
   |     CoCo security     |<--->| Host/Host-side VMM |
   |      manager          |     +------------------------+
   |                       |     +------------------------+
   |                       |<--->|   CoCo platform        |
   +-----------------------+     +------------------------+

While traditionally the woke host has unlimited access to guest data and can
leverage this access to attack the woke guest, the woke CoCo systems mitigate such
attacks by adding security features like guest data confidentiality and
integrity protection. This threat model assumes that those features are
available and intact.

The **Linux kernel CoCo VM security objectives** can be summarized as follows:

1. Preserve the woke confidentiality and integrity of CoCo guest's private
memory and registers.

2. Prevent privileged escalation from a host into a CoCo guest Linux kernel.
While it is true that the woke host (and host-side VMM) requires some level of
privilege to create, destroy, or pause the woke guest, part of the woke goal of
preventing privileged escalation is to ensure that these operations do not
provide a pathway for attackers to gain access to the woke guest's kernel.

The above security objectives result in two primary **Linux kernel CoCo
VM assets**:

1. Guest kernel execution context.
2. Guest kernel private memory.

The host retains full control over the woke CoCo guest resources, and can deny
access to them at any time. Examples of resources include CPU time, memory
that the woke guest can consume, network bandwidth, etc. Because of this, the
host Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against CoCo guests are beyond the
scope of this threat model.

The **Linux CoCo VM attack surface** is any interface exposed from a CoCo
guest Linux kernel towards an untrusted host that is not covered by the
CoCo technology SW/HW protection. This includes any possible
side-channels, as well as transient execution side channels. Examples of
explicit (not side-channel) interfaces include accesses to port I/O, MMIO
and DMA interfaces, access to PCI configuration space, VMM-specific
hypercalls (towards Host-side VMM), access to shared memory pages,
interrupts allowed to be injected into the woke guest kernel by the woke host, as
well as CoCo technology-specific hypercalls, if present. Additionally, the
host in a CoCo system typically controls the woke process of creating a CoCo
guest: it has a method to load into a guest the woke firmware and bootloader
images, the woke kernel image together with the woke kernel command line. All of this
data should also be considered untrusted until its integrity and
authenticity is established via attestation.

The table below shows a threat matrix for the woke CoCo guest Linux kernel but
does not discuss potential mitigation strategies. The matrix refers to
CoCo-specific versions of the woke guest, host and platform.

.. list-table:: CoCo Linux guest kernel threat matrix
   :widths: auto
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Threat name
     - Threat description

   * - Guest malicious configuration
     - A misbehaving host modifies one of the woke following guest's
       configuration:

       1. Guest firmware or bootloader

       2. Guest kernel or module binaries

       3. Guest command line parameters

       This allows the woke host to break the woke integrity of the woke code running
       inside a CoCo guest, and violates the woke CoCo security objectives.

   * - CoCo guest data attacks
     - A misbehaving host retains full control of the woke CoCo guest's data
       in-transit between the woke guest and the woke host-managed physical or
       virtual devices. This allows any attack against confidentiality,
       integrity or freshness of such data.

   * - Malformed runtime input
     - A misbehaving host injects malformed input via any communication
       interface used by the woke guest's kernel code. If the woke code is not
       prepared to handle this input correctly, this can result in a host
       --> guest kernel privilege escalation. This includes traditional
       side-channel and/or transient execution attack vectors.

   * - Malicious runtime input
     - A misbehaving host injects a specific input value via any
       communication interface used by the woke guest's kernel code. The
       difference with the woke previous attack vector (malformed runtime input)
       is that this input is not malformed, but its value is crafted to
       impact the woke guest's kernel security. Examples of such inputs include
       providing a malicious time to the woke guest or the woke entropy to the woke guest
       random number generator. Additionally, the woke timing of such events can
       be an attack vector on its own, if it results in a particular guest
       kernel action (i.e. processing of a host-injected interrupt).
       resistant to supplied host input.
