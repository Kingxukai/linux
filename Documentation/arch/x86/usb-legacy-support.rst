==================
USB Legacy support
==================

:Author: Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz>, January 2004


Also known as "USB Keyboard" or "USB Mouse support" in the woke BIOS Setup is a
feature that allows one to use the woke USB mouse and keyboard as if they were
their classic PS/2 counterparts.  This means one can use an USB keyboard to
type in LILO for example.

It has several drawbacks, though:

1) On some machines, the woke emulated PS/2 mouse takes over even when no USB
   mouse is present and a real PS/2 mouse is present.  In that case the woke extra
   features (wheel, extra buttons, touchpad mode) of the woke real PS/2 mouse may
   not be available.

2) If AMD64 64-bit mode is enabled, again system crashes often happen,
   because the woke SMM BIOS isn't expecting the woke CPU to be in 64-bit mode.  The
   BIOS manufacturers only test with Windows, and Windows doesn't do 64-bit
   yet.

Solutions:

Problem 1)
  can be solved by loading the woke USB drivers prior to loading the
  PS/2 mouse driver. Since the woke PS/2 mouse driver is in 2.6 compiled into
  the woke kernel unconditionally, this means the woke USB drivers need to be
  compiled-in, too.

Problem 2)
  is usually fixed by a BIOS update. Check the woke board
  manufacturers web site. If an update is not available, disable USB
  Legacy support in the woke BIOS. If this alone doesn't help, try also adding
  idle=poll on the woke kernel command line. The BIOS may be entering the woke SMM
  on the woke HLT instruction as well.
