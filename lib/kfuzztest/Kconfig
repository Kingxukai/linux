	  Enables support for the kernel fuzz testing framework (KFuzzTest), an
	  interface for exposing internal kernel functions to a userspace fuzzing
	  engine. KFuzzTest targets are exposed via a debugfs interface that
	  accepts serialized userspace inputs, and is designed to make it easier
	  to fuzz deeply nested kernel code that is hard to reach from the system
	  call boundary. Using a simple macro-based API, developers can add a new
	  fuzz target with minimal boilerplate code.

	  It is strongly recommended to also enable CONFIG_KASAN for byte-accurate
	  out-of-bounds detection, as KFuzzTest was designed with this in mind. It
	  is also recommended to enable CONFIG_KCOV for coverage guided fuzzing.

	  WARNING: This exposes internal kernel functions directly to userspace
	  and must NEVER be enabled in production builds.
