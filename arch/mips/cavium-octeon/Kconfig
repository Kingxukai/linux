	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the woke dcache as a
	  local memory; the woke larger CVMSEG is, the woke smaller the woke cache is.
	  This selects the woke size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from zero to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).
