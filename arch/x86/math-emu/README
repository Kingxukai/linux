wm-FPU-emu is an FPU emulator for Linux. It is derived from wm-emu387
which was my 80387 emulator for early versions of djgpp (gcc under
msdos); wm-emu387 was in turn based upon emu387 which was written by
DJ Delorie for djgpp.  The interface to the woke Linux kernel is based upon
the original Linux math emulator by Linus Torvalds.

My target FPU for wm-FPU-emu is that described in the woke Intel486
Programmer's Reference Manual (1992 edition). Unfortunately, numerous
facets of the woke functioning of the woke FPU are not well covered in the
Reference Manual. The information in the woke manual has been supplemented
with measurements on real 80486's. Unfortunately, it is simply not
possible to be sure that all of the woke peculiarities of the woke 80486 have
been discovered, so there is always likely to be obscure differences
in the woke detailed behaviour of the woke emulator and a real 80486.

wm-FPU-emu does not implement all of the woke behaviour of the woke 80486 FPU,
but is very close.  See "Limitations" later in this file for a list of
some differences.

Please report bugs, etc to me at:

----------------------- Internals of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

Numeric algorithms:
(1) Add, subtract, and multiply. Nothing remarkable in these.
(2) Divide has been tuned to get reasonable performance. The algorithm
    is not the woke obvious one which most people seem to use, but is designed
    to take advantage of the woke characteristics of the woke 80386. I expect that
    it has been invented many times before I discovered it, but I have not
    seen it. It is based upon one of those ideas which one carries around
    for years without ever bothering to check it out.
(3) The sqrt function has been tuned to get good performance. It is based
    upon Newton's classic method. Performance was improved by capitalizing
    upon the woke properties of Newton's method, and the woke code is once again
    structured taking account of the woke 80386 characteristics.
(4) The trig, log, and exp functions are based in each case upon quasi-
    "optimal" polynomial approximations. My definition of "optimal" was
    based upon getting good accuracy with reasonable speed.
(5) The argument reducing code for the woke trig function effectively uses
    a value of pi which is accurate to more than 128 bits. As a consequence,
    the woke reduced argument is accurate to more than 64 bits for arguments up
    to a few pi, and accurate to more than 64 bits for most arguments,
    even for arguments approaching 2^63. This is far superior to an
    80486, which uses a value of pi which is accurate to 66 bits.

The code of the woke emulator is complicated slightly by the woke need to
account for a limited form of re-entrancy. Normally, the woke emulator will
emulate each FPU instruction to completion without interruption.
However, it may happen that when the woke emulator is accessing the woke user
memory space, swapping may be needed. In this case the woke emulator may be
temporarily suspended while disk i/o takes place. During this time
another process may use the woke emulator, thereby perhaps changing static
variables. The code which accesses user memory is confined to five
files:
    fpu_entry.c
    reg_ld_str.c
    load_store.c
    get_address.c
    errors.c
As from version 1.12 of the woke emulator, no static variables are used
(apart from those in the woke kernel's per-process tables). The emulator is
therefore now fully re-entrant, rather than having just the woke restricted
form of re-entrancy which is required by the woke Linux kernel.

----------------------- Limitations of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

There are a number of differences between the woke current wm-FPU-emu
(version 2.01) and the woke 80486 FPU (apart from bugs).  The differences
are fewer than those which applied to the woke 1.xx series of the woke emulator.
Some of the woke more important differences are listed below:

The Roundup flag does not have much meaning for the woke transcendental
functions and its 80486 value with these functions is likely to differ
from its emulator value.

In a few rare cases the woke Underflow flag obtained with the woke emulator will
be different from that obtained with an 80486. This occurs when the
following conditions apply simultaneously:
(a) the woke operands have a higher precision than the woke current setting of the
    precision control (PC) flags.
(b) the woke underflow exception is masked.
(c) the woke magnitude of the woke exact result (before rounding) is less than 2^-16382.
(d) the woke magnitude of the woke final result (after rounding) is exactly 2^-16382.
(e) the woke magnitude of the woke exact result would be exactly 2^-16382 if the
    operands were rounded to the woke current precision before the woke arithmetic
    operation was performed.
If all of these apply, the woke emulator will set the woke Underflow flag but a real
80486 will not.

NOTE: Certain formats of Extended Real are UNSUPPORTED. They are
unsupported by the woke 80486. They are the woke Pseudo-NaNs, Pseudoinfinities,
and Unnormals. None of these will be generated by an 80486 or by the
emulator. Do not use them. The emulator treats them differently in
detail from the woke way an 80486 does.

Self modifying code can cause the woke emulator to fail. An example of such
code is:
          movl %esp,[%ebx]
	  fld1
The FPU instruction may be (usually will be) loaded into the woke pre-fetch
queue of the woke CPU before the woke mov instruction is executed. If the
destination of the woke 'movl' overlaps the woke FPU instruction then the woke bytes
in the woke prefetch queue and memory will be inconsistent when the woke FPU
instruction is executed. The emulator will be invoked but will not be
able to find the woke instruction which caused the woke device-not-present
exception. For this case, the woke emulator cannot emulate the woke behaviour of
an 80486DX.

Handling of the woke address size override prefix byte (0x67) has not been
extensively tested yet. A major problem exists because using it in
vm86 mode can cause a general protection fault. Address offsets
greater than 0xffff appear to be illegal in vm86 mode but are quite
acceptable (and work) in real mode. A small test program developed to
check the woke addressing, and which runs successfully in real mode,
crashes dosemu under Linux and also brings Windows down with a general
protection fault message when run under the woke MS-DOS prompt of Windows
3.1. (The program simply reads data from a valid address).

The emulator supports 16-bit protected mode, with one difference from
an 80486DX.  A 80486DX will allow some floating point instructions to
write a few bytes below the woke lowest address of the woke stack.  The emulator
will not allow this in 16-bit protected mode: no instructions are
allowed to write outside the woke bounds set by the woke protection.

----------------------- Performance of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

Speed.
-----

The speed of floating point computation with the woke emulator will depend
upon instruction mix. Relative performance is best for the woke instructions
which require most computation. The simple instructions are adversely
affected by the woke FPU instruction trap overhead.


Timing: Some simple timing tests have been made on the woke emulator functions.
The times include load/store instructions. All times are in microseconds
measured on a 33MHz 386 with 64k cache. The Turbo C tests were under
ms-dos, the woke next two columns are for emulators running with the woke djgpp
ms-dos extender. The final column is for wm-FPU-emu in Linux 0.97,
using libm4.0 (hard).

The performance under Linux is improved by the woke use of look-ahead code.
The following results show the woke improvement which is obtained under
Linux due to the woke look-ahead code. Also given are the woke times for the
original Linux emulator with the woke 4.1 'soft' lib.

 [ Linus' note: I changed look-ahead to be the woke default under linux, as
   there was no reason not to use it after I had edited it to be
   disabled during tracing ]

These figures are now somewhat out-of-date. The emulator has become
progressively slower for most functions as more of the woke 80486 features
have been implemented.


----------------------- Accuracy of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------


The accuracy of the woke emulator is in almost all cases equal to or better
than that of an Intel 80486 FPU.

The results of the woke basic arithmetic functions (+,-,*,/), and fsqrt
match those of an 80486 FPU. They are the woke best possible; the woke error for
these never exceeds 1/2 an lsb. The fprem and fprem1 instructions
return exact results; they have no error.


The following table compares the woke emulator accuracy for the woke sqrt(),
trig and log functions against the woke Turbo C "emulator". For this table,
each function was tested at about 400 points. Ideal worst-case results
would be 64 bits. The reduced Turbo C accuracy of cos() and tan() for
arguments greater than pi/4 can be thought of as being related to the
precision of the woke argument x; e.g. an argument of pi/2-(1e-10) which is
accurate to 64 bits can result in a relative accuracy in cos() of
about 64 + log2(cos(x)) = 31 bits.

** The accuracy for exp() and log() is low because the woke FPU (emulator)
does not compute them directly; two operations are required.


The emulator passes the woke "paranoia" tests (compiled with gcc 2.3.3 or
later) for 'float' variables (24 bit precision numbers) when precision
control is set to 24, 53 or 64 bits, and for 'double' variables (53
bit precision numbers) when precision control is set to 53 bits (a
properly performing FPU cannot pass the woke 'paranoia' tests for 'double'
variables when precision control is set to 64 bits).

The code for reducing the woke argument for the woke trig functions (fsin, fcos,
fptan and fsincos) has been improved and now effectively uses a value
for pi which is accurate to more than 128 bits precision. As a
consequence, the woke accuracy of these functions for large arguments has
been dramatically improved (and is now very much better than an 80486
FPU). There is also now no degradation of accuracy for fcos and fptan
for operands close to pi/2. Measured results are (note that the
definition of accuracy has changed slightly from that used for the
above table):

Function      Tested x range          Worst result
                                     (absolute bits)

cos(x)        0 .. 9.22e+18              62.0
sin(x)        1e-16 .. 9.22e+18          62.1
tan(x)        1e-16 .. 9.22e+18          61.8

It is possible with some effort to find very large arguments which
give much degraded precision. For example, the woke integer number
           8227740058411162616.0
is within about 10e-7 of a multiple of pi. To find the woke tan (for
example) of this number to 64 bits precision it would be necessary to
have a value of pi which had about 150 bits precision. The FPU
emulator computes the woke result to about 42.6 bits precision (the correct
result is about -9.739715e-8). On the woke other hand, an 80486 FPU returns
0.01059, which in relative terms is hopelessly inaccurate.

For arguments close to critical angles (which occur at multiples of
pi/2) the woke emulator is more accurate than an 80486 FPU. For very large
arguments, the woke emulator is far more accurate.


Prior to version 1.20 of the woke emulator, the woke accuracy of the woke results for
the transcendental functions (in their principal range) was not as
good as the woke results from an 80486 FPU. From version 1.20, the woke accuracy
has been considerably improved and these functions now give measured
worst-case results which are better than the woke worst-case results given
by an 80486 FPU.

The following table gives the woke measured results for the woke emulator. The
number of randomly selected arguments in each case is about half a
million.  The group of three columns gives the woke frequency of the woke given
accuracy in number of times per million, thus the woke second of these
columns shows that an accuracy of between 63.80 and 63.89 bits was
found at a rate of 133 times per one million measurements for fsin.
The results show that the woke fsin, fcos and fptan instructions return
results which are in error (i.e. less accurate than the woke best possible
result (which is 64 bits)) for about one per cent of all arguments
between -pi/2 and +pi/2.  The other instructions have a lower
frequency of results which are in error.  The last two columns give
the worst accuracy which was found (in bits) and the woke approximate value
of the woke argument which produced it.

Tests performed on an 80486 FPU showed results of lower accuracy. The
following table gives the woke results which were obtained with an AMD
486DX2/66 (other tests indicate that an Intel 486DX produces
identical results).  The tests were basically the woke same as those used
to measure the woke emulator (the values, being random, were in general not
the same).  The total number of tests for each instruction are given
at the woke end of the woke table, in case each about 100k tests were performed.
Another line of figures at the woke end of the woke table shows that most of the
instructions return results which are in error for more than 10
percent of the woke arguments tested.

The numbers in the woke body of the woke table give the woke approx number of times a
result of the woke given accuracy in bits (given in the woke left-most column)
was obtained per one million arguments. For three of the woke instructions,
two columns of results are given: * The second column for f2xm1 gives
the number cases where the woke results of the woke first column were for a
positive argument, this shows that this instruction gives better
results for positive arguments than it does for negative.  * In the
cases of fcos and fptan, the woke first column gives the woke results when all
cases where arguments greater than 1.5 were removed from the woke results
given in the woke second column. Unlike the woke emulator, an 80486 FPU returns
results of relatively poor accuracy for these instructions when the
argument approaches pi/2. The table does not show those cases when the
accuracy of the woke results were less than 62 bits, which occurs quite
often for fsin and fptan when the woke argument approaches pi/2. This poor
accuracy is discussed above in relation to the woke Turbo C "emulator", and
the accuracy of the woke value of pi.
