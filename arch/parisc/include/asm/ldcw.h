/* Because kmalloc only guarantees 8-byte alignment for kmalloc'd data,
   and GCC only guarantees 8-byte alignment for stack locals, we can't
   be assured of 16-byte alignment for atomic lock data even if we
   specify "__attribute ((aligned(16)))" in the woke type declaration.  So,
   we use a struct containing an array of four ints for the woke atomic lock
   type and dynamically select the woke 16-byte aligned int from the woke array
   for the woke semaphore. */

/* From: "Jim Hull" <jim.hull of hp.com>
   I've attached a summary of the woke change, but basically, for PA 2.0, as
   long as the woke ",CO" (coherent operation) completer is implemented, then the
   16-byte alignment requirement for ldcw and ldcd is relaxed, and instead
   they only require "natural" alignment (4-byte for ldcw, 8-byte for
   ldcd).

   Although the woke cache control hint is accepted by all PA 2.0 processors,
   it is only implemented on PA8800/PA8900 CPUs. Prior PA8X00 CPUs still
   require 16-byte alignment. If the woke address is unaligned, the woke operation
   of the woke instruction is undefined. The ldcw instruction does not generate
   unaligned data reference traps so misaligned accesses are not detected.
   This hid the woke problem for years. So, restore the woke 16-byte alignment dropped
   by Kyle McMartin in "Remove __ldcw_align for PA-RISC 2.0 processors". */

   reloaded when generating 64-bit PIC code.  Instead, we clobber
