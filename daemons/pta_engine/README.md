  "trigger": "UI_BUTTON_CLICK",
  "condition": "app:firefox AND element:save_button",
  "action": "suggest_backup",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

#### Sequence Rules
```json
{
  "type": "sequence",
  "trigger": ["UI_TEXT_WRITE", "UI_BUTTON_CLICK"],
  "condition": "app:gedit AND workflow:document_editing",
  "action": "auto_save",
  "confidence": 0.90
}
```

#### Temporal Rules

  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### Purpose
Manages the intensity of proactive behavior to avoid overwhelming users while maintaining helpfulness.

### Credit Allocation
- **Base Credit**: Daily allowance for proactive actions
- **Earned Credit**: Credits earned through successful suggestions
- **Spent Credit**: Credits consumed by proactive actions
- **Recovery Rate**: Credits recovered over time

### Credit Management
```c
struct attention_credit {
    int base_credits;      /* Daily allowance */
    int earned_credits;    /* Credits from successful actions */
    int spent_credits;     /* Credits used for proactive actions */
    time_t last_recovery;  /* Last credit recovery time */
    float recovery_rate;   /* Credits recovered per hour */
};
```

### Credit Rules
- **High-Value Actions**: Cost more credits but provide high benefit
- **Low-Value Actions**: Cost fewer credits for minor conveniences
- **User Override**: Users can spend extra credits for immediate actions
- **Learning**: Credit costs adjusted based on user feedback
