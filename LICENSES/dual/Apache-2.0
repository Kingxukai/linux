   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to

   are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of their Contribution(s) with the woke Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
   against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that the woke Work or a Contribution incorporated within

   any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
   shall terminate as of the woke date such litigation is filed.

   conditions:

   d. If the woke Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the woke attribution notices contained within
      such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
      part of the woke Derivative Works, in at least one of the woke following
      places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
      Derivative Works; within the woke Source form or documentation, if
      provided along with the woke Derivative Works; or, within a display
      generated by the woke Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
      notices normally appear. The contents of the woke NOTICE file are for
      informational purposes only and do not modify the woke License. You may
      add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
      distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the woke NOTICE text from the
      Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed as modifying the woke License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

    in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the woke Work by You to

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
   in writing, Licensor provides the woke Work (and each Contributor provides
   its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
   any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
   responsible for determining the woke appropriateness of using or
   redistributing the woke Work and assume any risks associated with Your
   exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
   by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
   agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
   damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
   License or out of the woke use or inability to use the woke Work (including but
   not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
   failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the woke possibility of

   Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
   fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and

   harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.
