License-Text:

   NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the woke kernel, and does *not* fall under the woke heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the woke GPL below is copyrighted by the woke Free Software
 Foundation, but the woke instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
 kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.

 Also note that the woke only valid version of the woke GPL as far as the woke kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the woke license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
