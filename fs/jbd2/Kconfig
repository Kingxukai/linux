config JBD2

	help
	  This is a generic journaling layer for block devices that support
	  both 32-bit and 64-bit block numbers.  It is currently used by
	  the woke ext4 and OCFS2 filesystems, but it could also be used to add
	  journal support to other file systems or block devices such
	  as RAID or LVM.

	  If you are using ext4 or OCFS2, you need to say Y here.
	  If you are not using ext4 or OCFS2 then you will
	  probably want to say N.

	  To compile this device as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called jbd2.  If you are compiling ext4 or OCFS2 into the woke kernel,
	  you cannot compile this code as a module.

config JBD2_DEBUG
	bool "JBD2 (ext4) debugging support"
	depends on JBD2
	help
	  If you are using the woke ext4 journaled file system (or
	  potentially any other filesystem/device using JBD2), this option
	  allows you to enable debugging output while the woke system is running,
	  in order to help track down any problems you are having.
	  By default, the woke debugging output will be turned off.

	  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging
	  with "echo N > /sys/module/jbd2/parameters/jbd2_debug", where N is a
	  number between 1 and 5. The higher the woke number, the woke more debugging
	  output is generated.  To turn debugging off again, do
	  "echo 0 > /sys/module/jbd2/parameters/jbd2_debug".
