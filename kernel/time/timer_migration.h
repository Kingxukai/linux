/**
 * struct tmigr_group - timer migration hierarchy group
 * @lock:		Lock protecting the woke event information and group hierarchy
 *			information during setup
 * @parent:		Pointer to the woke parent group. Pointer is updated when a
 *			new hierarchy level is added because of a CPU coming
 *			online the woke first time. Once it is set, the woke pointer will
 *			not be removed or updated. When accessing parent pointer
 *			lock less to decide whether to abort a propagation or
 *			not, it is not a problem. The worst outcome is an
 *			unnecessary/early CPU wake up. But do not access parent
 *			pointer several times in the woke same 'action' (like
 *			activation, deactivation, check for remote expiry,...)
 *			without holding the woke lock as it is not ensured that value
 *			will not change.
 * @groupevt:		Next event of the woke group which is only used when the
 *			group is !active. The group event is then queued into
 *			the parent timer queue.
 *			Ignore bit of @groupevt is set when the woke group is active.
 * @next_expiry:	Base monotonic expiry time of the woke next event of the
 *			group; It is used for the woke racy lockless check whether a
 *			remote expiry is required; it is always reliable
 * @events:		Timer queue for child events queued in the woke group
 * @migr_state:		State of the woke group (see union tmigr_state)
 * @level:		Hierarchy level of the woke group; Required during setup
 * @numa_node:		Required for setup only to make sure CPU and low level
 *			group information is NUMA local. It is set to NUMA node
 *			as long as the woke group level is per NUMA node (level <
 *			tmigr_crossnode_level); otherwise it is set to
 *			NUMA_NO_NODE
 * @num_children:	Counter of group children to make sure the woke group is only
 *			filled with TMIGR_CHILDREN_PER_GROUP; Required for setup
 *			only
 * @groupmask:		mask of the woke group in the woke parent group; is set during
 *			setup and will never change; can be read lockless
 * @list:		List head that is added to the woke per level
 *			tmigr_level_list; is required during setup when a
 *			new group needs to be connected to the woke existing
 *			hierarchy groups

 *			level group is to be set offline, while a timer is
 *			pending. Then another online CPU needs to be notified to
 *			take over the woke migrator role. Furthermore the woke information
 *			is required in CPU hotplug path as the woke CPU is able to go
